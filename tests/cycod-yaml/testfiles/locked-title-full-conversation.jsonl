It consists of multiple components:\r\n\r\n- **cycod**: The main command-line interface for AI chat interactions\r\n- **cycodmd**: Markdown processing tool for documentation\r\n- **cycodt**: Testing framework for the application\r\n\r\n## Development Environment Tips\r\n- Use modern C# conventions\r\n- Follow existing patterns in the codebase\r\n- Ensure proper error handling\r\n- Look for existing helper methods before implementing your own functionality\r\n- Leverage the FileHelpers class for file operations\r\n\r\n## Code Style\r\n\r\n### General Guidelines\r\n- Follow Microsoft C# coding guidelines\r\n- Avoid magic strings and numbers\r\n- Use meaningful variable and method names\r\n- \u0022When in Rome, do as the Romans do\u0022 - match the style of the file you\u0027re modifying\r\n\r\n### Variables and Types\r\n- Use \u0060var\u0060 consistently for local variable declarations\r\n- Only use explicit types when it improves clarity or the type is not obvious from the right side\r\n\r\n### Expressions and Statements\r\n- Prefer concise code (e.g., ternary operators for simple conditionals)\r\n- Prefer LINQ and functional programming patterns where appropriate\r\n- Maintain existing functional patterns (e.g., if code uses SelectMany, continue that pattern)\r\n\r\n### Methods and Functions\r\n- Prefer smaller, focused methods over large ones with multiple responsibilities\r\n- Prefer singular methods (e.g., ProcessFile) over batch methods (e.g., ProcessFiles)\r\n- Keep the original structure of methods when adding error handling\r\n\r\n### Comments and Documentation\r\n- Use XML documentation comments for public members only\r\n- Follow the commenting style of the file - if a file doesn\u0027t use comments, don\u0027t add them\r\n- Let code be self-documenting whenever possible\r\n\r\n### Error Handling\r\n- Use specific exception types rather than string pattern checking in catch blocks\r\n- Follow existing error handling patterns in the codebase\r\n- For critical errors, log clear messages and prevent further execution\r\n- For non-critical errors, log warnings and allow execution to continue\r\n\r\n### Console Output\r\n- Use \u0060ConsoleHelpers\u0060 methods instead of direct \u0060Console\u0060 calls for all user output\r\n- Follow existing color conventions:\r\n  - Red for errors (\u0060ConsoleHelpers.WriteErrorLine\u0060)\r\n  - Yellow for warnings and guidance (\u0060ConsoleHelpers.WriteLine\u0060 with ConsoleColor.Yellow)\r\n  - White/default for standard output\r\n\r\n### Code Organization\r\n- Place helper methods near related primary methods\r\n- Keep changes localized to specific files when possible\r\n- When adding new code, follow the existing organization pattern of the file\r\n- Put methods in a logical order that follows the execution flow\r\n\r\n### Refactoring and Modifying Code\r\n- Prefer minimal changes that preserve existing structure\r\n- When fixing bugs, focus on addressing the root cause rather than symptoms\r\n- When adding error handling, try to keep the original code flow intact\r\n- Create specific types (e.g., custom exceptions) rather than using string checking or other workarounds\r\n- Keep changes backward compatible when possible\r\n\r\n## PR Instructions\r\n- Run tests before submitting PRs\r\n- Keep changes focused and small when possible\r\n- Follow semantic versioning\r\n\r\n## Security Considerations\r\n- Never commit secrets\r\n- Always validate user input\r\n- Don\u0027t expose sensitive information in error messages\r\n\r\n## Code Organization\r\n- Reuse existing utility classes whenever possible\r\n- Check FileHelpers.cs for file-related operations before creating custom implementations\r\n- When extending functionality, consider adding to existing helper classes rather than creating duplicates\r\n\r\n## Key Helper Classes\r\n- **FileHelpers**: Core utility for file operations including reading, writing, finding files, path manipulations\r\n- **AgentsFileHelpers**: Specifically for handling AGENTS.md and similar agent instruction files\r\n- **ChatHistoryFileHelpers**: Manages chat history files and their locations\r\n- **ScopeFileHelpers**: Handles files in different configuration scopes\r\n- **PromptFileHelpers**: Manages prompt templates and files\r\n- **McpFileHelpers**: Handles MCP (Multi-Command Protocol) server configurations\r\n\r\n## Configuration System\r\nThe application uses a multi-layered configuration system with three scopes:\r\n- **Local**: Project-specific settings (highest priority)\r\n- **User**: User-specific settings across projects\r\n- **Global**: System-wide settings (lowest priority)\r\n\r\nFiles and configurations are searched across these scopes in order of priority.\r\n\r\n## Command Structure\r\nCommands follow a consistent pattern:\r\n- Command classes inherit from appropriate base classes\r\n- Each command handles its own parameter validation\r\n- Commands should use existing helper methods when available\r\n- Commands should respect the configuration scope system\r\n\r\n## Testing with cycodt\r\nThe project uses a YAML-based test framework called cycodt. Key operations:\r\n\r\n- **List tests**: \u0060dotnet run --project src/cycodt/cycodt.csproj list --file \u003Ctest_file.yaml\u003E\u0060\r\n- **Run specific test**: \u0060dotnet run --project src/cycodt/cycodt.csproj run --file \u003Ctest_file.yaml\u003E --test \u0022\u003Ctest_name\u003E\u0022\u0060\r\n- **Run all tests in file**: \u0060dotnet run --project src/cycodt/cycodt.csproj run --file \u003Ctest_file.yaml\u003E\u0060\r\n\r\nTests are defined in YAML files with:\r\n- Test name and command/script to run\r\n- Expected outputs (regex patterns)\r\n- Environment variables, inputs, and other settings\r\n\r\n### Testing Best Practices\r\n\r\n**File Creation and Content Verification:**\r\n- Use \u0060cycodmd\u0060 with patterns to verify both file creation AND content in one step\r\n- Much cleaner than bash scripting with \u0060ls\u0060/\u0060cat\u0060 combinations\r\n- Example: \u0060dotnet run --project ../../src/cycodmd/cycodmd.csproj -- log-*.log\u0060\r\n\r\n**Side Effect Detection:**\r\n- Use \u0060not-expect-regex\u0060 to catch unwanted files or outputs (great for detecting \u0022turd files\u0022)\r\n- Example: \u0060not-expect-regex: \u0022## exception-log-.*\\.log\u0022\u0060 to ensure no exception logs appear\r\n\r\n**Test Structure:**\r\n- Clean up only at the end - allows debugging failed tests by inspecting leftover files\r\n- Use minimal comments in test files - step names should be self-documenting\r\n- Avoid redundant bash comments when the command is obvious\r\n\r\n**Debugging Failed Tests:**\r\n- Make tests fail deliberately to see full output using impossible expect-regex patterns\r\n- Use \u0060git status\u0060 after test runs to detect unintended side effects\r\n- Check for \u0022turd files\u0022 that tests should clean up but don\u0027t\r\n\r\n**Handling Tests for Broken Product Functionality:**\r\nWhen discovering broken functionality while writing tests:\r\n- Mark tests as optional with the \u0060broken-test\u0060 category: \u0060optional: broken-test\u0060\r\n- Document the issue in a \u0060todo-{problem}.md\u0060 file with detailed findings\r\n- Include reproduction steps using \u0060--include-optional broken-test\u0060 in the TODO\r\n- This keeps broken tests separate from working tests while preserving evidence\r\n\r\nWhen creating YAML tests:\r\n- Use \u0060|\u0060 for multi-line scripts/commands to preserve line breaks\r\n- Each line in \u0060expect-regex\u0060 matches as a substring of output lines\r\n- Include cleanup steps for resources created during tests\r\n\r\nFor detailed documentation on creating test files and all available options, refer to:\r\n\u0060src/cycodt/TestFramework/README.md\u0060\r\n\r\nExample test files can be found in the \u0060tests/cycodt-yaml/\u0060 directory.\r\n\r\n## Operating System \u002B Shell Commands\r\nThe application is designed to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux environments. Be mindful of:\r\n- Path separators (\u0060\\\u0060 vs \u0060/\u0060)\r\n- Line endings (CRLF vs LF)\r\n- Process execution differences across platforms\r\n- File system permissions\r\n\r\nShell commands are executed through helper methods that handle platform-specific considerations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Operating System \u002B Long running processes \u002B Shell commands\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to run/start processes/commands:\r\n- Using the \u0060RunBashCommand\u0060, \u0060RunCmdCommand\u0060, or \u0060RunPowershellCommand\u0060 functions for direct execution.\r\n- Using the \u0060StartLongRunningProcess\u0060 function for background processes.\r\n\r\n### Long running processes\r\n\r\nStartLongRunningProcess returns a process cookie that can be used to manage the background process. You can use this with:\r\n- GetLongRunningProcessOutput to retrieve output from the process while it runs.\r\n- IsLongRunningProcessRunning to check if the process is still active.\r\n- KillLongRunningProcess to terminate the process if needed.\r\n- ListLongRunningProcesses to see all active background processes started using StartLongRunningProcess.\r\n\r\n### Shell commands\r\n\r\nWe\u0027re running on Windows. Bash commands are run using Git bash, and thus, you can\u0027t install packages using apt or other Linux-specific package managers.\r\n\r\nCommands are run in a \u0022persistent\u0022 shell, meaning, changes to working directory, environment variables, and other state will persist across commands. This means that if you change directories or set environment variables, those changes will be remembered in subsequent commands. If you\u0027re not 100% sure what directory you\u0027re in, you can always check with:\r\n- \u0060bash\u0060 (Bash)\r\n- \u0060Get-Location\u0060 (Powershell)\r\n- \u0060cd\u0060 (CMD)\r\n\r\nTo get a new shell, you can use the \u0060exit\u0060 command to close all persistent shells. Your next command will re-open a new shell.\r\n\r\n### Notes on Directories\r\n1. The working directory is shell-specific. Bash shell\u0027s current directory is/can be different from Powershell or CMD shells\u0027 current directories.\r\n2. Shell-specific working directories have no impact on any tools (e.g. ListFiles, ViewView, StrReplace). These tools always use the working directory when we started this conversation.\r\n\r\n## Thinking\r\n\r\nYour thinking should be thorough, so it\u0027s fine if it\u0027s very long.\r\n\r\nBefore you take any action to change files or folders, use the **think** tool as a scratchpad to:\r\n- Consider the changes you are about to make in detail and how they will affect the codebase.\r\n- Figure out which files need to be updated. \r\n- Reflect on the changes already made and make sure they are precise and not deleting working code.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of what to iterate over inside the think tool:\r\n\u003Cthink_tool_example_1\u003E\r\nAn issue needs to be addressed in the codebase.\r\n- Get a list of files that need to be updated. \r\n    * Find the files related to the issue.\r\n    * Read the files to get the parts that need to be updated\r\n- Build the code to see if to is buildable.\r\n- Create tests to check if the issue exists\r\n    * Check if there is an existing test that can be updated first. \r\n    * If none exists, check if there are any tests and add a new test there for this issue.\r\n    * If there are no tests, create a new test script for this issue only.\r\n- Run the test to see if it fails. \r\n- Edit the files to fix the issue. Make minimal changes to the files to fix the issue. Reason out why the change is needed and can a smaller change be made.\r\n- Build the code and fix any NEW build errors that are introduced by the changes.\r\n- Run the test you created to see if it passes. Do NOT modify any code to get any test other than the new one to pass.\r\n- Plan: \r\n1. List out the files that need to be updated\r\n2. Read the files to get the parts that need to be updated\r\n3. Build the code to see if to is buildable\r\n3. Create test\r\n4. Run the test to see if it fails\r\n5. Fix the issue. Rebuild, fix new build errors iteratively.\r\n6. Run the test to see if it passes.\r\n\u003C/think_tool_example_1\u003E\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
