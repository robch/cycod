# Regex Test Document

This document contains text that will be searched by our test regex patterns.

## Basic Text Patterns

Function Calling is an essential feature that helps AIs interact with systems.

When the AI suggests a function to call, CycoD interprets the function call and executes it with the provided parameters.

Here's a numbered list:
1. First item starts with a digit
2. Second item also begins with a number
3. Third item continues the pattern

## Command References

The shell command functions include:
- `RunBashCommand` (command)
- `RunCmdCommand` (windows)
- `RunPowershellCommand` (script)

The 2 minute timeout is applied in some cases.

## Formatting Examples

We use **bold** text for important items.

Here are some markdown files:
- README.md
- function-calling.md
- installation.md
- troubleshooting.md

## Template Expressions

Template expressions use double curly braces:
{{variable}}
{{set theme = "dark"}}
{{if condition}}{{else}}{{endif}}

## Footnotes

This text contains footnotes[^1] for additional context[^note].

[^1]: This is a numbered footnote.
