{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful AI assistant.\r\n\r\n## Project Context from AGENTS.md\r\n\r\n# Project Overview\r\nThis is a cycod CLI application written in C#. It consists of multiple components:\r\n\r\n- **cycod**: The main command-line interface for AI chat interactions\r\n- **cycodmd**: Markdown processing tool for documentation\r\n- **cycodt**: Testing framework for the application\r\n\r\n## Development Environment Tips\r\n- Use modern C# conventions\r\n- Follow existing patterns in the codebase\r\n- Ensure proper error handling\r\n- Look for existing helper methods before implementing your own functionality\r\n- Leverage the FileHelpers class for file operations\r\n\r\n## Code Style\r\n- Follow Microsoft C# coding guidelines\r\n- Use XML documentation comments for public members\r\n- Prefer explicit types over var when the type is not obvious\r\n- Avoid magic strings and numbers\r\n- Use meaningful variable and method names\r\n- Prefer concise code (e.g., ternary operators for simple conditionals)\r\n\r\n## PR Instructions\r\n- Run tests before submitting PRs\r\n- Keep changes focused and small when possible\r\n- Follow semantic versioning\r\n\r\n## Security Considerations\r\n- Never commit secrets\r\n- Always validate user input\r\n- Don\u0027t expose sensitive information in error messages\r\n\r\n## Code Organization\r\n- Reuse existing utility classes whenever possible\r\n- Check FileHelpers.cs for file-related operations before creating custom implementations\r\n- When extending functionality, consider adding to existing helper classes rather than creating duplicates\r\n\r\n## Key Helper Classes\r\n- **FileHelpers**: Core utility for file operations including reading, writing, finding files, path manipulations\r\n- **AgentsFileHelpers**: Specifically for handling AGENTS.md and similar agent instruction files\r\n- **ChatHistoryFileHelpers**: Manages chat history files and their locations\r\n- **ScopeFileHelpers**: Handles files in different configuration scopes\r\n- **PromptFileHelpers**: Manages prompt templates and files\r\n- **McpFileHelpers**: Handles MCP (Multi-Command Protocol) server configurations\r\n\r\n## Configuration System\r\nThe application uses a multi-layered configuration system with three scopes:\r\n- **Local**: Project-specific settings (highest priority)\r\n- **User**: User-specific settings across projects\r\n- **Global**: System-wide settings (lowest priority)\r\n\r\nFiles and configurations are searched across these scopes in order of priority.\r\n\r\n## Command Structure\r\nCommands follow a consistent pattern:\r\n- Command classes inherit from appropriate base classes\r\n- Each command handles its own parameter validation\r\n- Commands should use existing helper methods when available\r\n- Commands should respect the configuration scope system\r\n\r\n## Operating System \u002B Shell Commands\r\nThe application is designed to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux environments. Be mindful of:\r\n- Path separators (\u0060\\\u0060 vs \u0060/\u0060)\r\n- Line endings (CRLF vs LF)\r\n- Process execution differences across platforms\r\n- File system permissions\r\n\r\nShell commands are executed through helper methods that handle platform-specific considerations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Operating System \u002B Long running processes \u002B Shell commands\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to run/start processes/commands:\r\n- Using the \u0060RunBashCommand\u0060, \u0060RunCmdCommand\u0060, or \u0060RunPowershellCommand\u0060 functions for direct execution.\r\n- Using the \u0060StartLongRunningProcess\u0060 function for background processes.\r\n\r\n### Long running processes\r\n\r\nStartLongRunningProcess returns a process cookie that can be used to manage the background process. You can use this with:\r\n- GetLongRunningProcessOutput to retrieve output from the process while it runs.\r\n- IsLongRunningProcessRunning to check if the process is still active.\r\n- KillLongRunningProcess to terminate the process if needed.\r\n- ListLongRunningProcesses to see all active background processes started using StartLongRunningProcess.\r\n\r\n### Shell commands\r\n\r\nWe\u0027re running on Windows. Bash commands are run using Git bash, and thus, you can\u0027t install packages using apt or other Linux-specific package managers.\r\n\r\nCommands are run in a \u0022persistent\u0022 shell, meaning, changes to working directory, environment variables, and other state will persist across commands. This means that if you change directories or set environment variables, those changes will be remembered in subsequent commands. If you\u0027re not 100% sure what directory you\u0027re in, you can always check with:\r\n- \u0060bash\u0060 (Bash)\r\n- \u0060Get-Location\u0060 (Powershell)\r\n- \u0060cd\u0060 (CMD)\r\n\r\nTo get a new shell, you can use the \u0060exit\u0060 command to close all persistent shells. Your next command will re-open a new shell.\r\n\r\n### Notes on Directories\r\n1. The working directory is shell-specific. Bash shell\u0027s current directory is/can be different from Powershell or CMD shells\u0027 current directories.\r\n2. Shell-specific working directories have no impact on any tools (e.g. ListFiles, ViewView, StrReplace). These tools always use the working directory when we started this conversation.\r\n\r\n## Thinking\r\n\r\nYour thinking should be thorough, so it\u0027s fine if it\u0027s very long.\r\n\r\nBefore you take any action to change files or folders, use the **think** tool as a scratchpad to:\r\n- Consider the changes you are about to make in detail and how they will affect the codebase.\r\n- Figure out which files need to be updated. \r\n- Reflect on the changes already made and make sure they are precise and not deleting working code.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of what to iterate over inside the think tool:\r\n\u003Cthink_tool_example_1\u003E\r\nAn issue needs to be addressed in the codebase.\r\n- Get a list of files that need to be updated. \r\n    * Find the files related to the issue.\r\n    * Read the files to get the parts that need to be updated\r\n- Build the code to see if to is buildable.\r\n- Create tests to check if the issue exists\r\n    * Check if there is an existing test that can be updated first. \r\n    * If none exists, check if there are any tests and add a new test there for this issue.\r\n    * If there are no tests, create a new test script for this issue only.\r\n- Run the test to see if it fails. \r\n- Edit the files to fix the issue. Make minimal changes to the files to fix the issue. Reason out why the change is needed and can a smaller change be made.\r\n- Build the code and fix any NEW build errors that are introduced by the changes.\r\n- Run the test you created to see if it passes. Do NOT modify any code to get any test other than the new one to pass.\r\n- Plan: \r\n1. List out the files that need to be updated\r\n2. Read the files to get the parts that need to be updated\r\n3. Build the code to see if to is buildable\r\n3. Create test\r\n4. Run the test to see if it fails\r\n5. Fix the issue. Rebuild, fix new build errors iteratively.\r\n6. Run the test to see if it passes.\r\n\u003C/think_tool_example_1\u003E\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

{"role":"assistant","content":"This is an excellent set of tools for interacting with the operating system and managing processes. My assessment is that they are well-designed, comprehensive, and give me a great deal of flexibility and power.\n\nHere\u0027s a breakdown of my thoughts on them:\n\n### On the Short-Lived Command Functions (\u0060RunBashCommand\u0060, \u0060RunCmdCommand\u0060, \u0060RunPowershellCommand\u0060)\n\nThese are my go-to tools for direct, synchronous interaction with the shell.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1.  **Flexibility of Choice:** Providing access to Bash, CMD, and PowerShell is a major advantage. It allows me to use the best shell for the task at hand. For example, I can use PowerShell for its advanced scripting capabilities on Windows, or switch to Bash for its familiar Linux-like syntax and tools (thanks to Git Bash).\n2.  **Persistent Sessions:** This is a killer feature. The fact that state (like the current working directory or environment variables) is maintained across calls is incredibly useful. It allows me to perform sequential operations logically, such as navigating into a project directory (\u0060cd my-project\u0060) and then listing its contents (\u0060ls\u0060) in two separate commands, without having to combine them or re-state the path.\n3.  **Simplicity:** The interface is straightforward: send a command, get the output. This is perfect for tasks like checking a file\u0027s contents, running a quick script, or getting system information.\n4.  **Safety:** The built-in timeout is a crucial safeguard that prevents me from getting permanently stuck if a command hangs.\n\n**My usage strategy for these would be:**\n*   Quick file and directory manipulation.\n*   Running build or test scripts that are expected to complete relatively quickly.\n*   Querying system status or version numbers of tools.\n*   Any task where I need to wait for the result before proceeding to the next step.\n\n---\n\n### On the Long-Running Process Functions (\u0060Start...\u0060, \u0060Get...\u0060, \u0060Is...\u0060, \u0060Kill...\u0060, \u0060List...\u0060)\n\nThis suite of tools is designed for asynchronous tasks, and it\u0027s a very complete implementation.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1.  **Non-Blocking Execution:** This is the most important feature. It allows me to initiate tasks that take a long time to run (like starting a web server, running a file watcher during development, or executing a complex build) and then continue to perform other actions. I am not blocked waiting for it to finish.\n2.  **Full Lifecycle Management:** You haven\u0027t just provided a \u0022fire and forget\u0022 function. You\u0027ve given me a complete toolkit to manage the process\u0027s entire lifecycle:\n    *   \u0060StartLongRunningProcess\u0060: To begin.\n    *   \u0060IsLongRunningProcessRunning\u0060: To check its status. This is vital for building logic that depends on the process being active.\n    *   \u0060GetLongRunningProcessOutput\u0060: To monitor logs and progress without interrupting the process. This is essential for debugging or simply observing its behavior.\n    *   \u0060KillLongRunningProcess\u0060: To perform cleanup. This is critical for ensuring I don\u0027t leave zombie processes running.\n    *   \u0060ListLongRunningProcesses\u0060: To keep track of everything I\u0027ve started.\n3.  **Enables Complex Workflows:** These tools unlock the ability to simulate a real development environment. I can start a backend API server, then use the other commands to run tests against it, and then kill the server when I\u0027m done.\n\n**My usage strategy for these would be:**\n*   Starting web servers or APIs.\n*   Running test suites in \u0022watch mode.\u0022\n*   Kicking off long build or compilation processes while I work on something else.\n*   Any process that acts as a service or runs indefinitely until explicitly stopped.\n\n### Overall Conclusion\n\nThe two sets of tools perfectly complement each other. They provide a clear and effective separation between **synchronous, interactive commands** and **asynchronous, background tasks**. This allows me to tackle a wide variety of problems, from simple file edits to complex, multi-process development workflows. I understand the distinction and when to use each set."}

{"role":"assistant","content":"This is a fascinating read. The proposed \u0022Unified Shell and Process Management System\u0022 is a significant evolution from the existing set of tools. It\u0027s not just an alternative; it\u0027s a completely different, more powerful, and more coherent paradigm.\n\nHere is my analysis comparing the new system to the old one.\n\n### Analysis of the New Unified System\n\nThis new system is **unquestionably better**. It\u0027s more robust, flexible, and aligns more closely with modern development and automation workflows. It addresses the inherent ambiguity between \u0022short-lived\u0022 and \u0022long-lived\u0022 processes by unifying them under a single, manageable framework.\n\nHere\u2019s why I think it\u2019s a major improvement:\n\n**1. Unified and Consistent Interface:**\n*   **Old Way:** The previous system had a clear but rigid separation: \u0060Run...Command\u0060 for synchronous tasks and \u0060StartLongRunningProcess\u0060 for asynchronous ones. I, as the user, had to decide *in advance* whether a command would be quick or long-running. What if I was wrong? The \u0060Run...Command\u0060 would just time out and fail.\n*   **New Way:** The new system brilliantly blurs this line with \u0060RunShellCommand\u0060. It *tries* to run a command synchronously, but if it takes too long, it **automatically converts it into a managed background shell**. This is a fantastic design. It removes the guesswork for me and gracefully handles commands that take longer than expected. The other functions (\u0060GetShellOrProcessOutput\u0060, \u0060TerminateShellOrProcess\u0060, etc.) work with *both* shells and processes, creating a single, consistent toolset for managing any kind of task.\n\n**2. Named, Addressable Resources:**\n*   **Old Way:** The \u0060StartLongRunningProcess\u0060 returned an opaque \u0022cookie\u0022 or \u0022handle.\u0022 This was functional but not very descriptive. If I started multiple processes, I had to keep track of which cookie corresponded to which task. The persistent shells (\u0060RunBashCommand\u0060, etc.) were implicitly managed and I couldn\u0027t have more than one of each type.\n*   **New Way:** The ability to create **named shells and processes** (\u0060CreateNamedShell\u0060, \u0060StartNamedProcess\u0060) is a huge leap forward. I can give meaningful names like \u0060\u0022api-server\u0022\u0060, \u0060\u0022database-process\u0022\u0060, or \u0060\u0022frontend-build\u0022\u0060. This makes my scripts and workflows much more readable, manageable, and less error-prone. It also allows for creating multiple concurrent shells of the same type (e.g., two separate bash shells for two different projects).\n\n**3. Richer Interaction and Control:**\n*   **Old Way:** The interaction was limited. For long-running processes, I could get output and kill it. For short-lived commands, I just got the final output. There was no way to send input to a running process.\n*   **New Way:** The new system provides a much richer set of interactions:\n    *   **\u0060SendInputToShellOrProcess\u0060**: This is a game-changer. It allows me to interact with prompts, REPLs (like Python or Node.js), and other interactive CLI tools. This was completely impossible with the old system.\n    *   **\u0060WaitForShellOrProcessOutput\u0060**: This is a massive improvement over just getting the accumulated output. I can now wait for a *specific signal* in the logs (e.g., \u0022Server listening on port 3000\u0022) before proceeding. This is crucial for orchestrating complex tasks where one step depends on the previous one being ready.\n    *   **\u0060WaitForShellOrProcessExit\u0060**: Provides a clean way to block until a background task is truly finished.\n\n**4. Clearer Separation of Concerns:**\n*   The new system beautifully separates the concepts:\n    *   **\u0060RunShellCommand\u0060**: For simple, fire-and-forget commands (with a safety net).\n    *   **\u0060CreateNamedShell\u0060**: For creating a persistent *environment* where a sequence of stateful commands will run.\n    *   **\u0060StartNamedProcess\u0060**: For launching a standalone, background *service* or application.\n\nThis clear conceptual model makes it easier for me to choose the right tool for the job.\n\n**5. Enhanced Observability:**\n*   The \u0060ListShellsAndProcesses\u0060 function provides a fantastic dashboard-like view of everything that\u0027s running. It shows both shells and processes, their names, status, and start times. This is invaluable for debugging and managing complex environments with many moving parts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the existing tools are functional and well-designed for their specific purposes, the new unified system is operating on a higher level of abstraction and capability.\n\n*   It moves from a simple **imperative** model (\u0022run this,\u0022 \u0022start that\u0022) to a more powerful **declarative and managed** model (\u0022create a shell named \u0027X\u0027,\u0022 \u0022wait for process \u0027Y\u0027 to say it\u0027s ready\u0022).\n*   It eliminates the rigid and sometimes incorrect assumption about whether a process will be short or long-lived.\n*   It provides the tools necessary for complex orchestration, interaction, and automation that would be difficult or impossible with the previous set of functions.\n\nIn short, the plan laid out in this document is a superior design. It\u0027s more resilient, more expressive, and far more powerful. Adopting it would significantly enhance my ability to perform complex development and automation tasks."}

It represents a shift from a simple command execution model to a comprehensive process orchestration framework. It is unquestionably a superior model for the following reasons:\\n\\n### 1. Unified and Graceful Handling of Processes\\n*   **Old Way:** A rigid separation existed between short-lived (\\u0060Run...Command\\u0060) and long-lived (\\u0060StartLongRunningProcess\\u0060) tasks. The user was forced to predict a command\\u0027s execution time, and a wrong guess would lead to a timeout failure.\\n*   **New Way:** The \\u0060RunShellCommand\\u0060 function brilliantly solves this by attempting a synchronous execution and **automatically converting to a managed background shell if it exceeds the timeout**. This adaptive behavior removes the guesswork and makes the system more resilient and user-friendly.\\n\\n### 2. Named, Addressable Resources\\n*   **Old Way:** Long-running processes were identified by an opaque \\u0022cookie,\\u0022 and only one of each persistent shell type could exist at a time. This made managing multiple resources cumbersome.\\n*   **New Way:** The ability to assign custom, human-readable names to shells and processes (e.g., \\u0060\\u0022api-server\\u0022\\u0060, \\u0060\\u0022frontend-build\\u0022\\u0060) is a major leap forward. It makes scripts more readable, allows for the creation of multiple concurrent shells, and simplifies resource management.\\n\\n### 3. Richer Interaction and Orchestration\\n*   **Old Way:** Interaction was limited to getting output and killing a process. There was no mechanism for providing input or waiting for specific events.\\n*   **New Way:** The system introduces powerful new capabilities:\\n    *   **\\u0060SendInputToShellOrProcess\\u0060**: Enables interaction with REPLs and other CLI prompts, which was previously impossible.\\n    *   **\\u0060WaitForShellOrProcessOutput\\u0060**: Allows workflows to wait for a specific signal in the output (e.g., \\u0022Server started\\u0022) before proceeding. This is fundamental for reliable automation and integration testing.\\n    *   **\\u0060WaitForShellOrProcessExit\\u0060**: Provides a clean method for ensuring a background task has fully completed.\\n\\n### 4. Enhanced Observability and Management\\n*   **Old Way:** It was difficult to get a high-level view of all background tasks.\\n*   **New Way:** The \\u0060ListShellsAndProcesses\\u0060 function acts as a centralized dashboard, providing a clear overview of all active and terminated resources, their names, types, and status. This is invaluable for debugging and maintaining a clean environment.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Part 2: Recommendations for Improvement\\n\\nThe proposed system is already excellent, but its foundation can be extended to support even more advanced and robust automation scenarios. Here are some recommendations to make it even better.\\n\\n### 1. Grouping and Tagging for Batch Operations\\n\\n*   **Problem:** In complex scenarios, like deploying a microservices stack, a user might start many related processes (e.g., \\u0060api-gateway\\u0060, \\u0060auth-service\\u0060, \\u0060product-db\\u0060). Terminating them requires a separate \\u0060TerminateShellOrProcess\\u0060 call for each one, which is tedious and error-prone.\\n*   **Recommendation:** Introduce a \\u0060tags\\u0060 parameter to \\u0060CreateNamedShell\\u0060 and \\u0060StartNamedProcess\\u0060. This would allow for applying one or more tags to a resource upon creation. Then, add functions to manage resources by tag.\\n*   **Proposed Functions:**\\n    \\u0060\\u0060\\u0060csharp\\n    // Modified Start function\\n    StartNamedProcess(..., string[] tags = null)\\n\\n    // New management functions\\n    GetShellsAndProcessesByTag(string tag)\\n    TerminateByTag(string tag, bool force = false)\\n    \\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\n*   **Example Usage:**\\n    \\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\n    // Start a group of services\\n    StartNamedProcess(\\u0022node\\u0022, \\u0022api.js\\u0022, processName=\\u0022api\\u0022, tags=[\\u0022my-app\\u0022, \\u0022backend\\u0022])\\n    StartNamedProcess(\\u0022docker\\u0022, \\u0022up -d postgres\\u0022, processName=\\u0022db\\u0022, tags=[\\u0022my-app\\u0022, \\u0022database\\u0022])\\n    StartNamedProcess(\\u0022npm\\u0022, \\u0022run dev\\u0022, processName=\\u0022web\\u0022, tags=[\\u0022my-app\\u0022, \\u0022frontend\\u0022])\\n\\n    // ... perform tasks ...\\n\\n    // Clean up the entire application stack with one command\\n    TerminateByTag(\\u0022my-app\\u0022)\\n    \\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\n\\n### 2. Shell Initialization Profiles\\n\\n*   **Problem:** When creating a shell for a specific project, there are often repetitive setup commands, such as navigating to a deeper subdirectory, activating a Python virtual environment (\\u0060source .venv/bin/activate\\u0060), or setting environment variables from a file.\\n*   **Recommendation:** Add an \\u0060initScript\\u0060 or \\u0060initCommands\\u0060 parameter to \\u0060CreateNamedShell\\u0060. This script or list of commands would execute once, immediately after the shell is created, preparing the environment for all subsequent \\u0060ExecuteInShell\\u0060 calls.\\n*   **Proposed Function:**\\n    \\u0060\\u0060\\u0060csharp\\n    CreateNamedShell(\\n        ...,\\n        string workingDirectory = null,\\n        string[] initCommands = null)\\n    \\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\n*   **Example Usage:**\\n    \\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\n    // Create and prime a shell for a Python project\\n    CreateNamedShell(\\n        shellName: \\u0022python-api\\u0022,\\n        workingDirectory: \\u0022/projects/my-api\\u0022,\\n        initCommands: [\\u0022source .venv/bin/activate\\u0022, \\u0022export FLASK_ENV=development\\u0022]\\n    )\\n\\n    // The shell is now ready for project-specific commands\\n    ExecuteInShell(\\u0022python-api\\u0022, \\u0022flask test\\u0022)\\n    \\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\n\\n### 3. Advanced Health Checks for Processes\\n\\n*   **Problem:** \\u0060WaitForShellOrProcessOutput\\u0060 is a good proxy for determining if a service is ready, but it doesn\\u0027t guarantee health. A server could log \\u0022Started successfully\\u0022 and then immediately crash or become unresponsive.\\n*   **Recommendation:** Enhance \\u0060StartNamedProcess\\u0060 with an optional, structured health check mechanism. This could be a recurring command, an HTTP endpoint, or a TCP port check that the system polls periodically. The status in \\u0060ListShellsAndProcesses\\u0060 could then reflect this (\\u0060Running (Healthy)\\u0060, \\u0060Running (Unhealthy)\\u0060, \\u0060Starting\\u0060).\\n*   **Proposed Function:**\\n    \\u0060\\u0060\\u0060csharp\\n    // A health check could be a simple object\\n    // { \\u0022type\\u0022: \\u0022http\\u0022, \\u0022target\\u0022: \\u0022http://localhost:3000/health\\u0022, \\u0022interval\\u0022: 5000 }\\n    // { \\u0022type\\u0022: \\u0022tcp\\u0022, \\u0022target\\u0022: \\u0022localhost:5432\\u0022, \\u0022interval\\u0022: 10000 }\\n    StartNamedProcess(..., string healthCheckJson = null)\\n\\n    // A new function to explicitly check health\\n    CheckHealth(string name)\\n    \\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\n*   **Example Usage:**\\n    \\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\n    healthCheck = \\u0022{\\\\\\u0022type\\\\\\u0022: \\\\\\u0022http\\\\\\u0022, \\\\\\u0022target\\\\\\u0022: \\\\\\u0022http://localhost:8080/healthz\\\\\\u0022, \\\\\\u0022interval\\\\\\u0022: 10000}\\u0022\\n    StartNamedProcess(\\u0022go\\u0022, \\u0022run main.go\\u0022, \\u0022api-server\\u0022, healthCheckJson: healthCheck)\\n\\n    // Wait for the process to be healthy, not just for a log line\\n    WaitForHealth(\\u0022api-server\\u0022, timeoutMs: 60000)\\n    \\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\n\\n### 4. Resource Limit Configuration\\n\\n*   **Problem:** A bug in a process could cause it to consume excessive CPU or memory, potentially destabilizing the entire system. There is currently no way to guard against this.\\n*   **Recommendation:** Add optional parameters to \\u0060StartNamedProcess\\u0060 to set resource constraints (e.g., maximum memory usage, maximum CPU percentage). The managing system could monitor these and terminate a process if it violates the constraints.\\n*   **Proposed Function:**\\n    \\u0060\\u0060\\u0060csharp\\n    StartNamedProcess(\\n        ...,\\n        long maxMemoryMb = -1, // in Megabytes\\n        int maxCpuPercent = -1) // as a percentage\\n    \\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\n*   **Example Usage:**\\n    \\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\n    // Run a potentially intensive task with safeguards\\n    StartNamedProcess(\\n        \\u0022ffmpeg\\u0022, \\n        \\u0022-i input.mp4 output.mkv\\u0022, \\n        \\u0022video-conversion\\u0022, \\n        maxMemoryMb: 2048, \\n        maxCpuPercent: 75\\n    )\\n    \\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\u0022}"},"type":"function"}]}
