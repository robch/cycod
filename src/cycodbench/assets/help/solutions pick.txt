ARGUMENTS

  solutions-file-path        Path to solutions file to select solutions from

OPTIONS

  --id <problem-id>          ID of the problem to select solutions for (optional, default: all problems)
  --repo <repository>        Filter by repository name
  --contains <pattern>       Filter by text in problem (id, name, patch, tests)
  --max <n>                  Maximum number of problems to select
  --output <path>            Path to save selected solutions file (default: 'best-solutions.json')

EXAMPLES

  EXAMPLE 1: Select best solution for each problem
    cycodbench solutions pick solutions.json --output best-solutions.json

  EXAMPLE 2: Select best solution for a specific problem
    cycodbench solutions pick solutions.json --id astropy__astropy-12907 --output astropy-best.json

  EXAMPLE 3: Select best solutions from a specific repository
    cycodbench solutions pick solutions.json --repo "pandas" --output pandas-best.json

NOTES

  - This command selects the best solution for each problem from multiple candidates.
  - The selection process uses heuristics to determine which solution is most likely to succeed.
  - For problems with only one solution, that solution is automatically selected.
