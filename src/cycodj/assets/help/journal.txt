DESCRIPTION:
  The journal command creates a readable daily summary of your chat interactions,
  organized chronologically with grouping by time periods.
  
  For each day, conversations are grouped into:
  - Morning (before 12:00 PM)
  - Afternoon (12:00 PM - 5:00 PM)
  - Evening (5:00 PM and after)
  
  Each conversation entry shows:
  - Time of conversation
  - Conversation title (if available) or ID
  - Preview of your first question/message
  - Message count
  - Branch indicator (↳) if conversation was branched from another
  
  In --detailed mode, assistant response summaries are also included.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
  The journal displays:
  
  ═══════════════════════════════════════
  ## Journal for [Date]

  with a ↳ symbol, making it easy to see when you tried different approaches
  to the same problem.

  Combine with --detailed for more context about what was accomplished.
