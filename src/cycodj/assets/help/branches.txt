COMMAND: cycodj branches

DESCRIPTION:
  Displays conversation branching relationships in a tree structure.
  
  Analyzes chat history files to detect when conversations branch from each other
  (when you continue from an earlier point in a conversation). Shows the parent-child
  relationships in an easy-to-read tree format.

USAGE:
  cycodj branches [options]

OPTIONS:
  --date, -d <date>           Filter conversations by date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  --conversation, -c <id>     Show branches for a specific conversation
  --verbose, -v               Show detailed branching information
  --debug                     Enable debug output
  --quiet                     Suppress non-essential output

EXAMPLES:
  # Show all conversation branches
  cycodj branches

  # Show branches for a specific date
  cycodj branches --date 2024-12-20

  # Show branches with detailed information
  cycodj branches --verbose

  # Show branches for a specific conversation
  cycodj branches --conversation chat-history-1754437373970

OUTPUT:
  The tree view shows:
  📁 - Root conversations (no parent)
  ├─ - Branched conversations (has a parent)
  
  Example output:
    📁 2024-12-20 10:15:33 - Installing Git CLI
      ├─ 2024-12-20 10:22:15 - Trying alternative approach
      ├─ 2024-12-20 10:25:30 - Using chocolatey instead
        ├─ 2024-12-20 10:28:00 - Added configuration
        
  Conversations that share the same tool_call_id sequence at the beginning
  are identified as branches. The more tool_call_ids they share, the later
  in the conversation the branch point occurred.

VERBOSE MODE:
  With --verbose, shows additional details:
  - Number of messages (user, assistant)
  - Number of tool calls
  - Exact branch point (which tool call diverged)
