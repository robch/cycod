LOGGING IN CYCOD

  Logs capture detailed information about the application's operations,
  which is useful for debugging and troubleshooting issues.

LOG FILE LOCATION

  By default, log files are saved in the logs directory within your user profile:

  Windows: %USERPROFILE%\.cycod\logs\
  Mac/Linux: ~/.cycod/logs/

  Files are saved with timestamp-based names:
    - Default log format: log-{ProgramName}-{time}.log
    - Exception logs: exception-log-{ProgramName}-{time}.log

MANAGE AUTO-SAVING OF LOGS

  You can disable automatic saving of logs using the config command with the appropriate scope:

  DISABLE FOR THE CURRENT DIRECTORY ONLY (LOCAL SCOPE):
    cycod config set App.AutoSaveLog false --local

  DISABLE FOR ALL DIRECTORIES FOR CURRENT USER (USER SCOPE):
    cycod config set App.AutoSaveLog false --user

  DISABLE FOR ALL USERS ON THIS COMPUTER (GLOBAL SCOPE):
    cycod config set App.AutoSaveLog false --global

  To re-enable automatic saving, use the same commands with 'true' instead of 'false'.

  CHOOSING THE RIGHT SCOPE:
    - Use --local when you want to disable logging only for a specific project
    - Use --user when you want to disable logging for all your projects
    - Use --global when managing a shared system or setting company policy

  VERIFY YOUR SETTINGS:
    cycod config get App.AutoSaveLog

MANUAL LOGGING

  You can also specify a log file path explicitly using the CLI option:

    --log <path>    Write logs to the specified file

  When you provide this option, it takes precedence over automatic saving.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

  You can control logging behavior using environment variables:

  CYCOD_AUTO_SAVE_LOG="true"    Enable automatic log saving (default)
  CYCOD_AUTO_SAVE_LOG="false"   Disable automatic log saving

  LOG_LEVEL=Debug               Set the logging level (Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Fatal)
  LOG_LEVEL=Info                Default log level
