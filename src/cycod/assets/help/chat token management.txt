CYCOD CHAT TOKEN MANAGEMENT

  CycoD intelligently manages token usage to help you stay within model context
  limits while preserving the most important parts of your conversations.

TOKEN TYPES

  CycoD manages several different types of tokens:

  PROMPT TOKENS
    Tokens used in messages sent to the AI model, including:
    - System prompts
    - User messages
    - Assistant messages included in the context

  TOOL TOKENS
    Tokens used in function calls and results, including:
    - Function call names and arguments
    - Function results and returned data

  OUTPUT TOKENS
    Tokens generated by the AI model in its responses

  CHAT TOKENS
    The total tokens used in the entire conversation

TOKEN MANAGEMENT OPTIONS

  You can set token limits using command-line options:

  --max-prompt-tokens <number>    Maximum prompt token target (managed by CYCOD)
  --max-tool-tokens <number>      Maximum tool token target (managed by CYCOD)
  --max-output-tokens <number>    Maximum AI output tokens (provided to AI model)
  --max-tokens <number>           Maximum total chat tokens target (managed by CYCOD)

TOKEN MANAGEMENT METHODS

  CycoD offers two methods for managing tokens when conversations get too long:

  1. TRADITIONAL TRIMMING (DEFAULT)
     - Trims based on character counts and simple heuristics
     - Preserves recent messages while trimming older content
     - Faster but less intelligent about what content to keep
     - Automatic and happens in the background
     - Works by removing older messages until under token limit

  2. AI-BASED COMPACTION
     - Uses AI to create intelligent summaries of older conversation parts
     - Preserves the context and key information while reducing token count
     - Takes more time but maintains more context
     - Can be done automatically during chat or manually with the compact command
     - Works by replacing older messages with a concise AI-generated summary

ENABLING AUTOMATIC COMPACTION

  To enable automatic AI-based compaction during chat sessions:

    cycod config set App.CompactionMode full

  Configuration options:

    App.CompactionMode        Compaction mode: full, simple, or none
    App.PreserveMessages      Number of recent messages to preserve intact

MANUAL COMPACTION

  To manually compact a chat history file:

    cycod chat compact <file> [options]

  Key options:
    --compact [mode]            Specify compaction mode: full, simple, or none
    --preserve-messages <number>    Number of recent messages to preserve intact
    --max-tokens <number>       Maximum total chat tokens target (managed by CYCOD)
    --max-prompt-tokens <number>    Maximum prompt token target (managed by CYCOD)
    --max-tool-tokens <number>      Maximum tool token target (managed by CYCOD)

EXAMPLE USAGE

  EXAMPLE 1: Set token limits for a chat session

    cycod chat --max-tokens 32000 --max-output-tokens 2000

  EXAMPLE 2: Enable automatic compaction with configuration

    cycod config set App.CompactionMode full --user
    cycod config set App.PreserveMessages 6 --user

  EXAMPLE 3: Manually compact a large chat history

    cycod chat compact large-history.jsonl --max-tokens 16000 --preserve-messages 8
