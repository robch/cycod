CYCOD TIMEOUTS

  CycoD provides controls for API call timeouts to help manage network issues
  and long-running operations.

CHAT COMPLETION TIMEOUT

  The chat completion timeout controls how long CycoD will wait for a response
  from the AI provider API before timing out.

  USAGE: cycod --chat-completion-timeout SECONDS

  The timeout is specified in seconds. A value of 0 means no timeout (wait indefinitely).

SETTING THE TIMEOUT

  EXAMPLE 1: Set a timeout via command line

    cycod --chat-completion-timeout 60
    cycod --chat-completion-timeout 120
    cycod --chat-completion-timeout 300

  EXAMPLE 2: Set a timeout via config command

    cycod config set App.ChatCompletionTimeout 60
    cycod config set App.ChatCompletionTimeout 120 --user
    cycod config set App.ChatCompletionTimeout 300 --global

  EXAMPLE 3: Set a timeout via environment variable

    Set CYCOD_CHAT_COMPLETION_TIMEOUT to the desired timeout in seconds

DEFAULT TIMEOUT

  If not specified, CycoD uses a default timeout of 180 seconds (3 minutes).
  This can vary based on the AI model and provider being used.

RECOMMENDED TIMEOUT VALUES

  * 30-60 seconds: Quick questions with simple models
  * 120-180 seconds: Default for most interactions
  * 300+ seconds: Complex tasks like code generation or debugging
  * 0 (infinite): Long-running tasks that require deep analysis

HANDLING TIMEOUTS

  When a timeout occurs:
  1. CycoD will display a timeout message
  2. The current response will be truncated
  3. You may need to retry with a longer timeout value

PROVIDER-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

  Some providers may have their own timeout limitations:
  * OpenAI: May have server-side timeouts for certain models
  * Azure OpenAI: Configurable server-side timeouts
  * GitHub Copilot: May have different timeout behavior
