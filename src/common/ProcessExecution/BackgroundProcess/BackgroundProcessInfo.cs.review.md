## Issues Found

### Issue 1: Consider using UTC time for StartTime

**Style Guide Reference:**
```
// Time handling best practices suggest using UTC for timestamps
// when they might be compared across time zones or in distributed systems
```

**Code in Violation:**
```csharp
StartTime = DateTime.Now;  // Line 71
```

**Recommended Change:**
Consider using DateTime.UtcNow instead of DateTime.Now for more consistent timestamp handling, especially if this application might be distributed or if timestamps might be compared across different time zones.

```csharp
StartTime = DateTime.UtcNow;
```

This is a minor suggestion and depends on the specific requirements of the application.

## Review Summary

The file is well-structured and follows the C# coding style guidelines very effectively. The code is clean, readable, and organized logically. The class has a clear, single responsibility with well-named properties and methods.

Only one minor suggestion was identified regarding the use of DateTime.Now vs DateTime.UtcNow, which might be considered depending on the application's requirements.
