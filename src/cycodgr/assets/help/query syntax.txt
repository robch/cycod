CYCODGR QUERY SYNTAX

Understanding how cycodgr searches GitHub

SEARCH QUERIES

  Your search queries are passed directly to GitHub's search API.
  GitHub supports various query syntax features:

BASIC SYNTAX

  Multiple words (space-separated) perform AND search:
    cycodgr --repo-contains "hello world"
    → Finds repos containing BOTH "hello" AND "world"
  
  Quoted phrases perform exact phrase search:
    cycodgr --file-contains "import React"
    → Finds code containing the exact phrase "import React"

BOOLEAN OPERATORS

  GitHub search supports OR and NOT operators (must be uppercase):
  
  OR operator:
    cycodgr --repo-contains "python OR ruby"
    → Finds repos containing either "python" or "ruby"
  
  NOT operator:
    cycodgr --repo-contains "python NOT django"
    → Finds repos containing "python" but not "django"

FILTERING

  Combine search queries with filter flags:
    cycodgr --repo-contains "authentication" --language csharp --owner microsoft
    cycodgr --file-contains "error handling" --language cs
    cycodgr --contains "rate limiting" --min-stars 100

SORTING

  By default, results are sorted by relevance (best-match), which considers:
  - How well search terms match
  - Repository activity and recency
  - Popularity (weighted with other factors)
  
  For other sort orders:
    cycodgr --repo-contains "dotnet" --sort stars          # Most popular first
    cycodgr --repo-contains "dotnet" --sort forks          # Most forked first
    cycodgr --repo-contains "dotnet" --sort updated        # Most recently updated first

EXAMPLES

  EXAMPLE 1: Search with multiple keywords
    cycodgr --repo-contains "machine learning framework"
    → Repos with "machine" AND "learning" AND "framework"
  
  EXAMPLE 2: Exact phrase search
    cycodgr --file-contains "import React"
    → Code containing exactly "import React"
  
  EXAMPLE 3: With filters
    cycodgr --repo-contains "web api microservices" --language csharp --min-stars 100
    → C# repos with those keywords and at least 100 stars
