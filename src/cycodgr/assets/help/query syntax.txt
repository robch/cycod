CYCODGR QUERY SYNTAX

Understanding how cycodgr searches GitHub

BASIC SYNTAX

  Multiple words (space-separated) perform AND search:
    cycodgr repo hello world
    → Finds repos containing BOTH "hello" AND "world" (anywhere)
  
  Quoted phrases perform exact phrase search:
    cycodgr repo "hello world"
    → Finds repos containing the exact phrase "hello world"

KEYWORDS

  Single keywords:
    cycodgr repo dotnet
    → Finds repos containing "dotnet"
  
  Multiple keywords (AND search):
    cycodgr repo dotnet aspire
    → Finds repos containing BOTH "dotnet" AND "aspire"
  
  Exact phrases:
    cycodgr repo "minimal api"
    → Finds repos containing the exact phrase "minimal api"
  
  Mixed (keywords + phrases):
    cycodgr repo dotnet "minimal api"
    → Finds repos containing "dotnet" AND the phrase "minimal api"

BOOLEAN OPERATORS

  GitHub search supports OR and NOT operators (must be uppercase):
  
  OR operator:
    cycodgr repo "python OR ruby"
    → Finds repos containing either "python" or "ruby"
  
  NOT operator:
    cycodgr repo "python NOT django"
    → Finds repos containing "python" but not "django"
  
  Note: Operators must be uppercase and usually work best in quotes

QUALIFIERS

  Add filters to narrow results:
    cycodgr repo authentication --language csharp --owner microsoft
    cycodgr repo "rate limiting" --min-stars 100
    cycodgr code "error handling" --extension cs --repo dotnet/aspire

SORTING

  By default, results are sorted by relevance (best-match), which considers:
  - How well search terms match (name > description)
  - Repository activity and recency
  - Popularity (stars, but weighted with other factors)
  
  This gives you the most targeted results for your specific query.
  
  For other sort orders:
    cycodgr repo dotnet --sort stars          # Most popular first
    cycodgr repo dotnet --sort forks          # Most forked first
    cycodgr repo dotnet --sort updated        # Most recently updated first
  
  Best-match (default) is recommended for problem-solving and finding
  specific examples. Use --sort stars when you want the most popular/trusted
  libraries regardless of how well they match your specific query.

EXAMPLES

  EXAMPLE 1: AND search (multiple keywords)
    cycodgr repo machine learning framework
    → Repos with "machine" AND "learning" AND "framework"
  
  EXAMPLE 2: Exact phrase
    cycodgr code "import React"
    → Code containing exactly "import React"
  
  EXAMPLE 3: Mixed search
    cycodgr repo dotnet "web api" microservices
    → Repos with "dotnet" AND exact phrase "web api" AND "microservices"
  
  EXAMPLE 4: With qualifiers
    cycodgr repo authentication authorization --language csharp
    → C# repos with both "authentication" and "authorization"

HOW SHELL QUOTING WORKS

  When you type commands in your shell:
  
  Unquoted words become separate arguments:
    cycodgr repo hello world
    → Shell passes: ["hello", "world"] → AND search
  
  Quoted strings become single arguments:
    cycodgr repo "hello world"
    → Shell passes: ["hello world"] → Phrase search
  
  This is how cycodgr knows your intent!
