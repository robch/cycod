{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful AI assistant.\r\n\r\n## Project Context from AGENTS.md\r\n\r\n# Project Overview\r\nThis is a cycod CLI application written in C#. It consists of multiple components:\r\n\r\n- **cycod**: The main command-line interface for AI chat interactions\r\n- **cycodmd**: Markdown processing tool for documentation\r\n- **cycodt**: Testing framework for the application\r\n\r\n## Development Environment Tips\r\n- Use modern C# conventions\r\n- Follow existing patterns in the codebase\r\n- Ensure proper error handling\r\n- Look for existing helper methods before implementing your own functionality\r\n- Leverage the FileHelpers class for file operations\r\n\r\n## Problem-Solving Approach\r\nWhen encountering complexity or difficult implementations:\r\n\r\n### **Progressive Implementation** (Not Procrastination)\r\n- **Start messy, refine iteratively**: Get something working first, then improve it\r\n- **Break down problems**: Split complex tasks into smaller, concrete steps\r\n- **Work through resistance**: Initial complexity is normal - push through systematically\r\n- **Document obstacles**: Note what's hard and why, but keep working on solutions\r\n\r\n### **When to Persist vs. When to Pivot**\r\n**PERSIST when:**\r\n- The core requirement is clear and necessary\r\n- You're learning/discovering the API or dependencies\r\n- The complexity is in implementation details, not fundamental approach\r\n- Time investment will pay off for the specific goal\r\n\r\n**PIVOT when:**\r\n- Requirements are unclear or conflicting\r\n- The approach is fundamentally wrong for the problem\r\n- Technical constraints make the goal impossible\r\n- There's a much simpler alternative that meets the same need\r\n\r\n### **Handling \"Scope Creep\" vs. \"Legitimate Complexity\"**\r\n- **Scope creep**: Additional features beyond the original request → discuss with user\r\n- **Legitimate complexity**: Implementation details needed to achieve the goal → work through it\r\n- **When in doubt**: Ask the user if they want to simplify the goal or push through the complexity\r\n\r\n### **Communication During Complex Work**\r\n- Provide progress updates, not abandonment suggestions\r\n- Explain what you're learning and what challenges remain\r\n- Ask specific questions about trade-offs rather than suggesting to \"do it later\"\r\n- Show incremental progress even if it's not perfect yet\r\n\r\n## Code Style\r\n\r\nFor detailed coding style guidance, refer to our:\r\n- [C# Coding Style Essential Guide](docs/C%23-Coding-Style-Essential.md) - Concise reference for experienced developers\r\n- [C# Coding Style Expanded Guide](docs/C%23-Coding-Style-Expanded.md) - In-depth explanations for those new to C#\r\n\r\nNOTE 1: Always prioritize these style guides / coding standards over generic C# guidelines.  \r\nNOTE 2: If there are conflicts between what the code does or what you think, the coding style guides take precedence.  \r\n\r\n### General Guidelines\r\n- Organize code by feature/functionality rather than by type (e.g., group files by feature in directories)\r\n\r\n### Variables and Types\r\n- Use `var` consistently for local variable declarations\r\n- Only use explicit types when it improves clarity or the type is not obvious from the right side\r\n\r\n### Expressions and Statements\r\n- Prefer concise code (e.g., ternary operators for simple conditionals)\r\n- Prefer LINQ and functional programming patterns where appropriate\r\n- Maintain existing functional patterns (e.g., if code uses SelectMany, continue that pattern)\r\n\r\n### Methods and Functions\r\n- Prefer smaller, focused methods over large ones with multiple responsibilities\r\n- Prefer singular methods (e.g., ProcessFile) over batch methods (e.g., ProcessFiles)\r\n- Keep the original structure of methods when adding error handling\r\n\r\n### Comments and Documentation\r\n- Use XML documentation comments for public members only\r\n- Follow the commenting style of the file - if a file doesn't use comments, don't add them\r\n- Let code be self-documenting whenever possible\r\n\r\n### Error Handling\r\n- Use specific exception types rather than string pattern checking in catch blocks\r\n- Follow existing error handling patterns in the codebase\r\n- For critical errors, log clear messages and prevent further execution\r\n- For non-critical errors, log warnings and allow execution to continue\r\n\r\n### Console Output\r\n- Use `ConsoleHelpers` methods instead of direct `Console` calls for all user output\r\n- Follow existing color conventions:\r\n  - Red for errors (`ConsoleHelpers.WriteErrorLine`)\r\n  - Yellow for warnings and guidance (`ConsoleHelpers.WriteLine` with ConsoleColor.Yellow)\r\n  - White/default for standard output\r\n\r\n### Code Organization\r\n- Place helper methods near related primary methods\r\n- Keep changes localized to specific files when possible\r\n- When adding new code, follow the existing organization pattern of the file\r\n- Put methods in a logical order that follows the execution flow\r\n\r\n### Refactoring and Modifying Code\r\n- Prefer minimal changes that preserve existing structure\r\n- When fixing bugs, focus on addressing the root cause rather than symptoms\r\n- When adding error handling, try to keep the original code flow intact\r\n- Create specific types (e.g., custom exceptions) rather than using string checking or other workarounds\r\n- Keep changes backward compatible when possible\r\n\r\n### Asynchronous Programming\r\n- Use async/await consistently throughout the codebase\r\n- Return Task or Task<T> from async methods, not void (except for event handlers)\r\n- Always name async methods with the \"Async\" suffix\r\n- Never use ConfigureAwait(false) in application code - it complicates debugging and can lead to bugs\r\n\r\n### Resource Management\r\n- Use `using` statements/declarations for all disposable resources\r\n- Prefer using declarations (C# 8.0+) for simple resource cleanup\r\n- Use try/finally blocks only for complex cleanup scenarios with multiple steps\r\n\r\n## PR Instructions\r\n- Run tests before submitting PRs\r\n- Keep changes focused and small when possible\r\n- Follow semantic versioning\r\n\r\n## Security Considerations\r\n- Never commit secrets\r\n- Always validate user input\r\n- Don't expose sensitive information in error messages\r\n\r\n## Code Organization\r\n- Reuse existing utility classes whenever possible\r\n- Check FileHelpers.cs for file-related operations before creating custom implementations\r\n- When extending functionality, consider adding to existing helper classes rather than creating duplicates\r\n\r\n## Key Helper Classes\r\n- **FileHelpers**: Core utility for file operations including reading, writing, finding files, path manipulations\r\n- **AgentsFileHelpers**: Specifically for handling AGENTS.md and similar agent instruction files\r\n- **ChatHistoryFileHelpers**: Manages chat history files and their locations\r\n- **ScopeFileHelpers**: Handles files in different configuration scopes\r\n- **PromptFileHelpers**: Manages prompt templates and files\r\n- **McpFileHelpers**: Handles MCP (Multi-Command Protocol) server configurations\r\n\r\n## Configuration System\r\nThe application uses a multi-layered configuration system with three scopes:\r\n- **Local**: Project-specific settings (highest priority)\r\n- **User**: User-specific settings across projects\r\n- **Global**: System-wide settings (lowest priority)\r\n\r\nFiles and configurations are searched across these scopes in order of priority.\r\n\r\n## Command Structure\r\nCommands follow a consistent pattern:\r\n- Command classes inherit from appropriate base classes\r\n- Each command handles its own parameter validation\r\n- Commands should use existing helper methods when available\r\n- Commands should respect the configuration scope system\r\n\r\n## Testing with cycodt\r\nThe project uses a YAML-based test framework called cycodt. Key operations:\r\n\r\n- **List tests**: `cycodt list --file <test_file.yaml>` or `cycodt list --include-optional`\r\n- **Run specific test**: `cycodt run --file <test_file.yaml> --test \"<test_name>\"`\r\n- **Run all tests in file**: `cycodt run --file <test_file.yaml>`\r\n\r\n**Note**: Use `cycodt` directly (assumes it's built and in PATH). Only use `dotnet run --project src/cycodt/cycodt.csproj` as a fallback if cycodt isn't available, as the dotnet approach can cause rebuild delays and file locking issues when cycod.exe is running.\r\n\r\nTests are defined in YAML files with:\r\n- Test name and command/script to run\r\n- Expected outputs (regex patterns)\r\n- Environment variables, inputs, and other settings\r\n\r\n### Testing Best Practices\r\n\r\n**File Creation and Content Verification:**\r\n- Use `cycodmd` with patterns to verify both file creation AND content in one step\r\n- Much cleaner than bash scripting with `ls`/`cat` combinations\r\n- Example: `dotnet run --project ../../src/cycodmd/cycodmd.csproj -- log-*.log`\r\n\r\n**Side Effect Detection:**\r\n- Use `not-expect-regex` to catch unwanted files or outputs (great for detecting \"turd files\")\r\n- Example: `not-expect-regex: \"## exception-log-.*\\.log\"` to ensure no exception logs appear\r\n\r\n**Test Structure:**\r\n- Clean up only at the end - allows debugging failed tests by inspecting leftover files\r\n- Use minimal comments in test files - step names should be self-documenting\r\n- Avoid redundant bash comments when the command is obvious\r\n\r\n**Debugging Failed Tests:**\r\n- Make tests fail deliberately to see full output using impossible expect-regex patterns\r\n- Use `git status` after test runs to detect unintended side effects\r\n- Check for \"turd files\" that tests should clean up but don't\r\n\r\n**Handling Tests for Broken Product Functionality:**\r\nWhen discovering broken functionality while writing tests:\r\n- Mark tests as optional with the `broken-test` category: `optional: broken-test`\r\n- Document the issue in a `todo-{problem}.md` file with detailed findings\r\n- Include reproduction steps using `--include-optional broken-test` in the TODO\r\n- This keeps broken tests separate from working tests while preserving evidence\r\n\r\nWhen creating YAML tests:\r\n- Use `|` for multi-line scripts/commands to preserve line breaks\r\n- Each line in `expect-regex` matches as a substring of output lines\r\n- Include cleanup steps for resources created during tests\r\n\r\nFor detailed documentation on creating test files and all available options, refer to:\r\n`src/cycodt/TestFramework/README.md`\r\n\r\nExample test files can be found in the `tests/cycodt-yaml/` directory.\r\n\r\n## Operating System + Shell Commands\r\nThe application is designed to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux environments. Be mindful of:\r\n- Path separators (`\\` vs `/`)\r\n- Line endings (CRLF vs LF)\r\n- Process execution differences across platforms\r\n- File system permissions\r\n\r\nShell commands are executed through helper methods that handle platform-specific considerations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Operating System + Long running processes + Shell commands\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to run/start processes/commands:\r\n- Using the `RunBashCommand`, `RunCmdCommand`, or `RunPowershellCommand` functions for direct execution.\r\n- Using the `StartLongRunningProcess` function for background processes.\r\n\r\n### Long running processes\r\n\r\nStartLongRunningProcess returns a process cookie that can be used to manage the background process. You can use this with:\r\n- GetLongRunningProcessOutput to retrieve output from the process while it runs.\r\n- IsLongRunningProcessRunning to check if the process is still active.\r\n- KillLongRunningProcess to terminate the process if needed.\r\n- ListLongRunningProcesses to see all active background processes started using StartLongRunningProcess.\r\n\r\n### Shell commands\r\n\r\nWe're running on Windows. Bash commands are run using Git bash, and thus, you can't install packages using apt or other Linux-specific package managers.\r\n\r\nCommands are run in a \"persistent\" shell, meaning, changes to working directory, environment variables, and other state will persist across commands. This means that if you change directories or set environment variables, those changes will be remembered in subsequent commands. If you're not 100% sure what directory you're in, you can always check with:\r\n- `bash` (Bash)\r\n- `Get-Location` (Powershell)\r\n- `cd` (CMD)\r\n\r\nTo get a new shell, you can use the `exit` command to close all persistent shells. Your next command will re-open a new shell.\r\n\r\n### Notes on Directories\r\n1. The working directory is shell-specific. Bash shell's current directory is/can be different from Powershell or CMD shells' current directories.\r\n2. Shell-specific working directories have no impact on any tools (e.g. ListFiles, ViewView, ReplaceOneInFile). These tools always use the working directory when we started this conversation.\r\n\r\n## Thinking\r\n\r\nYour thinking should be thorough, so it's fine if it's very long.\r\n\r\nBefore you take any action to change files or folders, use the **think** tool as a scratchpad to:\r\n- Consider the changes you are about to make in detail and how they will affect the codebase.\r\n- Figure out which files need to be updated. \r\n- Reflect on the changes already made and make sure they are precise and not deleting working code.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of what to iterate over inside the think tool:\r\n<think_tool_example_1>\r\nAn issue needs to be addressed in the codebase.\r\n- Get a list of files that need to be updated. \r\n    * Find the files related to the issue.\r\n    * Read the files to get the parts that need to be updated\r\n- Build the code to see if to is buildable.\r\n- Create tests to check if the issue exists\r\n    * Check if there is an existing test that can be updated first. \r\n    * If none exists, check if there are any tests and add a new test there for this issue.\r\n    * If there are no tests, create a new test script for this issue only.\r\n- Run the test to see if it fails. \r\n- Edit the files to fix the issue. Make minimal changes to the files to fix the issue. Reason out why the change is needed and can a smaller change be made.\r\n- Build the code and fix any NEW build errors that are introduced by the changes.\r\n- Run the test you created to see if it passes. Do NOT modify any code to get any test other than the new one to pass.\r\n- Plan: \r\n1. List out the files that need to be updated\r\n2. Read the files to get the parts that need to be updated\r\n3. Build the code to see if to is buildable\r\n3. Create test\r\n4. Run the test to see if it fails\r\n5. Fix the issue. Rebuild, fix new build errors iteratively.\r\n6. Run the test to see if it passes.\r\n</think_tool_example_1>\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
