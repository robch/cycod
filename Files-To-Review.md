# Files to Review

This document lists the files that need to be reviewed as part of the enhanced process and shell management system implementation. These files were identified from the implementation commit (279d2e32).

## Primary Implementation Files

These files form the core of the enhanced process and shell management system:

1. - [ ] src/cycod/FunctionCallingTools/UnifiedShellAndProcessHelperFunctions.cs (NEW)
2. - [ ] src/cycod/FunctionCallingTools/ShellCommandToolHelperFunctions.cs (MODIFIED - Deprecated)
3. - [ ] src/cycod/FunctionCallingTools/BackgroundProcessHelperFunctions.cs (MODIFIED - Deprecated)

## Backend Support Classes

These files implement the underlying functionality for the new unified API:

4. - [ ] src/common/ProcessExecution/RunnableProcess/RunnableProcess.cs (MODIFIED)
5. - [ ] src/common/ProcessExecution/BackgroundProcess/BackgroundProcessInfo.cs (MODIFIED)
6. - [ ] src/common/ProcessExecution/EnhancedBackgroundProcessManager.cs (NEW)
7. - [ ] src/common/ProcessExecution/PersistentShell/PersistentShellProcess.cs (MODIFIED)
8. - [ ] src/common/ProcessExecution/ResourceMonitor.cs (NEW)
9. - [ ] src/common/ProcessExecution/ShellExecutionResults.cs (MODIFIED)
10. - [ ] src/common/ProcessExecution/ShellState.cs (NEW)

## Shell Session Implementation

These files handle the specifics of different shell types:

11. - [ ] src/common/ShellHelpers/ShellSession.cs (MODIFIED)
12. - [ ] src/common/ShellHelpers/BashShellSession.cs (MODIFIED)
13. - [ ] src/common/ShellHelpers/CmdShellSession.cs (MODIFIED)
14. - [ ] src/common/ShellHelpers/PowershellShellSession.cs (MODIFIED)
15. - [ ] src/common/ShellHelpers/NamedShellManager.cs (NEW)

## Integration Points

These files integrate the new functionality with the rest of the application:

16. - [ ] src/cycod/CommandLineCommands/ChatCommand.cs (MODIFIED)
17. - [ ] src/cycod/CycoDevProgramRunner.cs (MODIFIED)

## Documentation

18. - [ ] todo/shell-process-management-improvements.md (NEW)

## Review Priority

1. **High Priority** (Core API and integration points):
   - UnifiedShellAndProcessHelperFunctions.cs
   - ShellCommandToolHelperFunctions.cs (deprecated)
   - BackgroundProcessHelperFunctions.cs (deprecated)
   - ChatCommand.cs
   - CycoDevProgramRunner.cs

2. **Medium Priority** (Key implementation classes):
   - EnhancedBackgroundProcessManager.cs
   - NamedShellManager.cs
   - RunnableProcess.cs
   - ShellSession.cs

3. **Lower Priority** (Supporting classes):
   - Remaining files

## Review Focus Areas

1. **API Design**: Evaluate the UnifiedShellAndProcessHelperFunctions.cs for clarity, consistency, and usability
2. **Deprecation Approach**: Check how ShellCommandToolHelperFunctions.cs and BackgroundProcessHelperFunctions.cs are deprecated
3. **Resource Management**: Review proper disposal of resources and memory management
4. **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling throughout the implementation
5. **Integration**: Verify correct integration with existing systems in ChatCommand.cs and CycoDevProgramRunner.cs
