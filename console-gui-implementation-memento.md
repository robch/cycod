## What We're Building

We are porting the console GUI system from the Azure AI CLI tool to cycod, enabling:

1. **Interactive UI Components** - ListBoxPicker, EditBox, TextViewer, HelpViewer
2. **Context Menus** - Enhanced user interaction in CLI applications

- [ ] Selecting options works correctly
- [ ] Integration doesn't break existing chat functionality

### Speech Recognition Phase (Phase 5)
- [ ] --speech flag enables speech input
- [ ] Context menu includes "speech" option when enabled
- [ ] Speech recognition shows "(listening)..." prompt
- [ ] Interim results display in real-time
- [ ] Final recognized text integrates with chat
- [ ] Configuration files work correctly
- [ ] Clear error messages for missing credentials

### Testing Phase (Phase 7)
- [ ] All components work on Windows, macOS, Linux
- [ ] cycodt YAML tests pass
- [ ] No regressions in existing cycod functionality
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Code follows cycod style guidelines

## Notes

### The Memento Pattern
This document follows the "Memento" approach:
- **Immediate Orientation**: Read "Current Position" and "Next Action Required"
- **Context Preservation**: Detailed progress tracking and decisions
- **Archaeological Recovery**: Daily mementos preserve reasoning
- **Incremental Progress**: Small, testable chunks
- **Clear Handoffs**: Always know what to do next

### Workflow for Each Session
1. **Read** this document's "Current Position" and "Next Action Required"
2. **Do** the work for ONE phase/sub-phase
3. **Test** that it works
4. **Document** in daily memento (`console-gui-day-N.md`)
5. **Update** this memento with new "Current Position"
6. **Commit** to git with clear message

### Similar to Chess Variants Pattern
Just like documenting chess variants one-by-one:
- Do ONE component at a time
- Port, fix, test, document
- Mark it complete
- Move to next

This approach allows picking up where we left off even with complete context loss.

---

**Remember**: The power of this system is in its ability to preserve context across discontinuities. Always update the "Current Position" and "Next Action Required" before stepping away.
