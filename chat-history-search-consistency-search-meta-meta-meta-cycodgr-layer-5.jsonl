It consists of multiple components:\r\n\r\n- **cycod**: The main command-line interface for AI chat interactions\r\n- **cycodmd**: Markdown processing tool for documentation\r\n- **cycodt**: Testing framework for the application\r\n\r\n## Development Environment Tips\r\n- Use modern C# conventions\r\n- Follow existing patterns in the codebase\r\n- Ensure proper error handling\r\n- Look for existing helper methods before implementing your own functionality\r\n- Leverage the FileHelpers class for file operations\r\n\r\n## Problem-Solving Approach\r\nWhen encountering complexity or difficult implementations:\r\n\r\n### **Progressive Implementation** (Not Procrastination)\r\n- **Start messy, refine iteratively**: Get something working first, then improve it\r\n- **Break down problems**: Split complex tasks into smaller, concrete steps\r\n- **Work through resistance**: Initial complexity is normal - push through systematically\r\n- **Document obstacles**: Note what's hard and why, but keep working on solutions\r\n\r\n### **When to Persist vs. When to Pivot**\r\n**PERSIST when:**\r\n- The core requirement is clear and necessary\r\n- You're learning/discovering the API or dependencies\r\n- The complexity is in implementation details, not fundamental approach\r\n- Time investment will pay off for the specific goal\r\n\r\n**PIVOT when:**\r\n- Requirements are unclear or conflicting\r\n- The approach is fundamentally wrong for the problem\r\n- Technical constraints make the goal impossible\r\n- There's a much simpler alternative that meets the same need\r\n\r\n### **Handling \"Scope Creep\" vs. \"Legitimate Complexity\"**\r\n- **Scope creep**: Additional features beyond the original request → discuss with user\r\n- **Legitimate complexity**: Implementation details needed to achieve the goal → work through it\r\n- **When in doubt**: Ask the user if they want to simplify the goal or push through the complexity\r\n\r\n### **Communication During Complex Work**\r\n- Provide progress updates, not abandonment suggestions\r\n- Explain what you're learning and what challenges remain\r\n- Ask specific questions about trade-offs rather than suggesting to \"do it later\"\r\n- Show incremental progress even if it's not perfect yet\r\n\r\n## Code Style\r\n\r\nFor detailed coding style guidance, refer to our:\r\n- [C# Coding Style Essential Guide](docs/C%23-Coding-Style-Essential.md) - Concise reference for experienced developers\r\n- [C# Coding Style Expanded Guide](docs/C%23-Coding-Style-Expanded.md) - In-depth explanations for those new to C#\r\n\r\nNOTE 1: Always prioritize these style guides / coding standards over generic C# guidelines.  \r\nNOTE 2: If there are conflicts between what the code does or what you think, the coding style guides take precedence.  \r\n\r\n### General Guidelines\r\n- Organize code by feature/functionality rather than by type (e.g., group files by feature in directories)\r\n\r\n### Variables and Types\r\n- Use `var` consistently for local variable declarations\r\n- Only use explicit types when it improves clarity or the type is not obvious from the right side\r\n\r\n### Expressions and Statements\r\n- Prefer concise code (e.g., ternary operators for simple conditionals)\r\n- Prefer LINQ and functional programming patterns where appropriate\r\n- Maintain existing functional patterns (e.g., if code uses SelectMany, continue that pattern)\r\n\r\n### Methods and Functions\r\n- Prefer smaller, focused methods over large ones with multiple responsibilities\r\n- Prefer singular methods (e.g., ProcessFile) over batch methods (e.g., ProcessFiles)\r\n- Keep the original structure of methods when adding error handling\r\n\r\n### Comments and Documentation\r\n- Use XML documentation comments for public members only\r\n- Follow the commenting style of the file - if a file doesn't use comments, don't add them\r\n- Let code be self-documenting whenever possible\r\n\r\n### Error Handling\r\n- Use specific exception types rather than string pattern checking in catch blocks\r\n- Follow existing error handling patterns in the codebase\r\n- For critical errors, log clear messages and prevent further execution\r\n- For non-critical errors, log warnings and allow execution to continue\r\n\r\n### Console Output\r\n- Use `ConsoleHelpers` methods instead of direct `Console` calls for all user output\r\n- Follow existing color conventions:\r\n  - Red for errors (`ConsoleHelpers.WriteErrorLine`)\r\n  - Yellow for warnings and guidance (`ConsoleHelpers.WriteLine` with ConsoleColor.Yellow)\r\n  - White/default for standard output\r\n\r\n### Code Organization\r\n- Place helper methods near related primary methods\r\n- Keep changes localized to specific files when possible\r\n- When adding new code, follow the existing organization pattern of the file\r\n- Put methods in a logical order that follows the execution flow\r\n\r\n### Refactoring and Modifying Code\r\n- Prefer minimal changes that preserve existing structure\r\n- When fixing bugs, focus on addressing the root cause rather than symptoms\r\n- When adding error handling, try to keep the original code flow intact\r\n- Create specific types (e.g., custom exceptions) rather than using string checking or other workarounds\r\n- Keep changes backward compatible when possible\r\n\r\n### Asynchronous Programming\r\n- Use async/await consistently throughout the codebase\r\n- Return Task or Task<T> from async methods, not void (except for event handlers)\r\n- Always name async methods with the \"Async\" suffix\r\n- Never use ConfigureAwait(false) in application code - it complicates debugging and can lead to bugs\r\n\r\n### Resource Management\r\n- Use `using` statements/declarations for all disposable resources\r\n- Prefer using declarations (C# 8.0+) for simple resource cleanup\r\n- Use try/finally blocks only for complex cleanup scenarios with multiple steps\r\n\r\n## PR Instructions\r\n- Run tests before submitting PRs\r\n- Keep changes focused and small when possible\r\n- Follow semantic versioning\r\n\r\n## Security Considerations\r\n- Never commit secrets\r\n- Always validate user input\r\n- Don't expose sensitive information in error messages\r\n\r\n## Code Organization\r\n- Reuse existing utility classes whenever possible\r\n- Check FileHelpers.cs for file-related operations before creating custom implementations\r\n- When extending functionality, consider adding to existing helper classes rather than creating duplicates\r\n\r\n## Key Helper Classes\r\n- **FileHelpers**: Core utility for file operations including reading, writing, finding files, path manipulations\r\n- **AgentsFileHelpers**: Specifically for handling AGENTS.md and similar agent instruction files\r\n- **ChatHistoryFileHelpers**: Manages chat history files and their locations\r\n- **ScopeFileHelpers**: Handles files in different configuration scopes\r\n- **PromptFileHelpers**: Manages prompt templates and files\r\n- **McpFileHelpers**: Handles MCP (Multi-Command Protocol) server configurations\r\n\r\n## Configuration System\r\nThe application uses a multi-layered configuration system with three scopes:\r\n- **Local**: Project-specific settings (highest priority)\r\n- **User**: User-specific settings across projects\r\n- **Global**: System-wide settings (lowest priority)\r\n\r\nFiles and configurations are searched across these scopes in order of priority.\r\n\r\n## Command Structure\r\nCommands follow a consistent pattern:\r\n- Command classes inherit from appropriate base classes\r\n- Each command handles its own parameter validation\r\n- Commands should use existing helper methods when available\r\n- Commands should respect the configuration scope system\r\n\r\n## Testing with cycodt\r\nThe project uses a YAML-based test framework called cycodt. Key operations:\r\n\r\n- **List tests**: `cycodt list --file <test_file.yaml>` or `cycodt list --include-optional`\r\n- **Run specific test**: `cycodt run --file <test_file.yaml> --test \"<test_name>\"`\r\n- **Run all tests in file**: `cycodt run --file <test_file.yaml>`\r\n\r\n**Note**: Use `cycodt` directly (assumes it's built and in PATH). Only use `dotnet run --project src/cycodt/cycodt.csproj` as a fallback if cycodt isn't available, as the dotnet approach can cause rebuild delays and file locking issues when cycod.exe is running.\r\n\r\nTests are defined in YAML files with:\r\n- Test name and command/script to run\r\n- Expected outputs (regex patterns)\r\n- Environment variables, inputs, and other settings\r\n\r\n### Testing Best Practices\r\n\r\n**File Creation and Content Verification:**\r\n- Use `cycodmd` with patterns to verify both file creation AND content in one step\r\n- Much cleaner than bash scripting with `ls`/`cat` combinations\r\n- Example: `dotnet run --project ../../src/cycodmd/cycodmd.csproj -- log-*.log`\r\n\r\n**Side Effect Detection:**\r\n- Use `not-expect-regex` to catch unwanted files or outputs (great for detecting \"turd files\")\r\n- Example: `not-expect-regex: \"## exception-log-.*\\.log\"` to ensure no exception logs appear\r\n\r\n**Test Structure:**\r\n- Clean up only at the end - allows debugging failed tests by inspecting leftover files\r\n- Use minimal comments in test files - step names should be self-documenting\r\n- Avoid redundant bash comments when the command is obvious\r\n\r\n**Debugging Failed Tests:**\r\n- Make tests fail deliberately to see full output using impossible expect-regex patterns\r\n- Use `git status` after test runs to detect unintended side effects\r\n- Check for \"turd files\" that tests should clean up but don't\r\n\r\n**Handling Tests for Broken Product Functionality:**\r\nWhen discovering broken functionality while writing tests:\r\n- Mark tests as optional with the `broken-test` category: `optional: broken-test`\r\n- Document the issue in a `todo-{problem}.md` file with detailed findings\r\n- Include reproduction steps using `--include-optional broken-test` in the TODO\r\n- This keeps broken tests separate from working tests while preserving evidence\r\n\r\nWhen creating YAML tests:\r\n- Use `|` for multi-line scripts/commands to preserve line breaks\r\n- Each line in `expect-regex` matches as a substring of output lines\r\n- Include cleanup steps for resources created during tests\r\n\r\nFor detailed documentation on creating test files and all available options, refer to:\r\n`src/cycodt/TestFramework/README.md`\r\n\r\nExample test files can be found in the `tests/cycodt-yaml/` directory.\r\n\r\n## Operating System + Shell Commands\r\nThe application is designed to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux environments. Be mindful of:\r\n- Path separators (`\\` vs `/`)\r\n- Line endings (CRLF vs LF)\r\n- Process execution differences across platforms\r\n- File system permissions\r\n\r\nShell commands are executed through helper methods that handle platform-specific considerations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Operating System + Long running processes + Shell commands\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to run/start processes/commands:\r\n- Using the `RunBashCommand`, `RunCmdCommand`, or `RunPowershellCommand` functions for direct execution.\r\n- Using the `StartLongRunningProcess` function for background processes.\r\n\r\n### Long running processes\r\n\r\nStartLongRunningProcess returns a process cookie that can be used to manage the background process. You can use this with:\r\n- GetLongRunningProcessOutput to retrieve output from the process while it runs.\r\n- IsLongRunningProcessRunning to check if the process is still active.\r\n- KillLongRunningProcess to terminate the process if needed.\r\n- ListLongRunningProcesses to see all active background processes started using StartLongRunningProcess.\r\n\r\n### Shell commands\r\n\r\nWe're running on Windows. Bash commands are run using Git bash, and thus, you can't install packages using apt or other Linux-specific package managers.\r\n\r\nCommands are run in a \"persistent\" shell, meaning, changes to working directory, environment variables, and other state will persist across commands. This means that if you change directories or set environment variables, those changes will be remembered in subsequent commands. If you're not 100% sure what directory you're in, you can always check with:\r\n- `bash` (Bash)\r\n- `Get-Location` (Powershell)\r\n- `cd` (CMD)\r\n\r\nTo get a new shell, you can use the `exit` command to close all persistent shells. Your next command will re-open a new shell.\r\n\r\n### Notes on Directories\r\n1. The working directory is shell-specific. Bash shell's current directory is/can be different from Powershell or CMD shells' current directories.\r\n2. Shell-specific working directories have no impact on any tools (e.g. ListFiles, ViewView, ReplaceOneInFile). These tools always use the working directory when we started this conversation.\r\n\r\n## Thinking\r\n\r\nYour thinking should be thorough, so it's fine if it's very long.\r\n\r\nBefore you take any action to change files or folders, use the **think** tool as a scratchpad to:\r\n- Consider the changes you are about to make in detail and how they will affect the codebase.\r\n- Figure out which files need to be updated. \r\n- Reflect on the changes already made and make sure they are precise and not deleting working code.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of what to iterate over inside the think tool:\r\n<think_tool_example_1>\r\nAn issue needs to be addressed in the codebase.\r\n- Get a list of files that need to be updated. \r\n    * Find the files related to the issue.\r\n    * Read the files to get the parts that need to be updated\r\n- Build the code to see if to is buildable.\r\n- Create tests to check if the issue exists\r\n    * Check if there is an existing test that can be updated first. \r\n    * If none exists, check if there are any tests and add a new test there for this issue.\r\n    * If there are no tests, create a new test script for this issue only.\r\n- Run the test to see if it fails. \r\n- Edit the files to fix the issue. Make minimal changes to the files to fix the issue. Reason out why the change is needed and can a smaller change be made.\r\n- Build the code and fix any NEW build errors that are introduced by the changes.\r\n- Run the test you created to see if it passes. Do NOT modify any code to get any test other than the new one to pass.\r\n- Plan: \r\n1. List out the files that need to be updated\r\n2. Read the files to get the parts that need to be updated\r\n3. Build the code to see if to is buildable\r\n3. Create test\r\n4. Run the test to see if it fails\r\n5. Fix the issue. Rebuild, fix new build errors iteratively.\r\n6. Run the test to see if it passes.\r\n</think_tool_example_1>\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Consistent across config, alias, prompt, mcp commands\\n\\n4. **Time specification patterns**:\\n   - Multiple formats: relative (\\u00607d\\u0060, \\u0060-7d\\u0060, \\u00607d..\\u0060), absolute, keywords (\\u0060today\\u0060, \\u0060yesterday\\u0060)\\n   - Appears in: cycodmd (file times), cycodj (conversation times)\\n   - Helper: \\u0060TimeSpecHelpers\\u0060\\n\\n5. **Multi-level filtering**:\\n   - cycodgr has THE most complex: repo-level, file-level, line-level\\n   - Web search: URL-level, page-level, content-level\\n   - cycodj: conversation-level, branch-level, message-level\\n\\n6. **Format output**:\\n   - cycodgr: \\u0060--format\\u0060 (repos, urls, files, json, csv, table)\\n   - cycodt: \\u0060--output-format\\u0060 (trx, junit)\\n   - Inconsistent naming\\n\\n7. **Missing cross-pollination**:\\n   - cycodj doesn\\u0027t have \\u0060--line-numbers\\u0060 equivalent for messages\\n   - cycodmd doesn\\u0027t have stats aggregation like cycodj \\u0060--stats\\u0060\\n   - cycodgr could benefit from cycodj\\u0027s time-relative filtering\\n   - Web search could use more of the filtering layers\\n\\n## What to Create\\n\\nI should create a comprehensive catalog document that:\\n1. Maps out all the layers/stages of the pipeline\\n2. Shows which tools implement which layers\\n3. Identifies naming patterns and inconsistencies\\n4. Highlights missing features/cross-pollination opportunities\\n5. Suggests standardization opportunities\\n6. Identifies fractal/recursive patterns\\n7.

loaded)\\n\\n**Pattern**: \\u0060show \\u003CID\\u003E\\u0060 with display options\\n\\n**Gaps**:\\n- Inconsistent across tools\\n- Could benefit from \\u0060cycodgr show \\u003Crepo\\u003E\\u0060 or

for Standardization\\n\\n### Priority 1: Critical Inconsistencies\\n1. **Unify \\u0060--exclude\\u0060 semantics**\\n   - Separate options per layer: \\u0060--exclude-files\\u0060, \\u0060--exclude-lines\\u0060, \\u0060--exclude-repos\\u0060, \\u0060--exclude-urls\\u0060\\n   - Keep \\u0060--exclude\\u0060 as shorthand for most common case per tool\\n\\n2. **Standardize time filtering**\\n   - All tools use: \\u0060--when\\u0060, \\u0060--after\\u0060, \\u0060--before\\u0060, \\u0060--today\\u0060, \\u0060--yesterday\\u0060\\n   - Use \\u0060TimeSpecHelpers\\u0060 universally\\n\\n3. **Unify format options**\\n   - All tools use \\u0060--format\\u0060 (not \\u0060--output-format\\u0060)\\n   - Support common formats: \\u0060json\\u0060, \\u0060csv\\u0060, \\u0060table\\u0060, \\u0060markdown\\u0060\\n\\n4. **Standardize result limiting**\\n   - All tools use \\u0060--max-results\\u0060 (not \\u0060--max\\u0060, not \\u0060--messages\\u0060)\\n\\n### Priority 2: Feature Gaps\\n1. **Add \\u0060--stats\\u0060 to all search tools**\\n2. **Add \\u0060--line-numbers\\u0060 to all content display tools**\\n3. **Add \\u0060--context\\u0060 / \\u0060--lines\\u0060 to all tools showing line-level content**\\n4. **Add \\u0060--remove-all-lines\\u0060 equivalent to all tools with line display**\\n\\n### Priority 3: Innovation\\n1. **Implement filter presets** (save/load complex filter combinations)\\n2. **Add cross-tool result chaining** (pipe outputs)\\n3. **Create unified filtering DSL** (domain-specific language)\\n4. **Add interactive refinement mode**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Appendix: Complete Option Inventory\\n\\n### cycodmd\\n\\n#### Target Selection\\n- Positional: glob patterns\\n- \\u0060--exclude\\u0060: glob/regex patterns\\n-

I've created a comprehensive **CLI Filtering Patterns Catalog** that documents:\n\n## What's Cataloged\n\n1. **9 Conceptual Layers** of the filtering pipeline:\n   - Target Selection → Container Filter → Content Filter → Content Removal → Context Expansion → Display Control → Output Persistence → AI Processing → Actions on Results\n\n2. **Complete Option Inventory** for all tools:\n   - cycodmd (file/web search)\n   - cycodj (conversation journal)\n   - cycodgr (GitHub search)\n   - cycodt (test framework)\n   - cycod (chat interface)\n\n3. **Pattern Analysis**:\n   - ✅ Strong patterns (consistent across tools)\n   - ⚠️ Weak patterns (inconsistent naming/semantics)\n   - ❌ Missing cross-pollination opportunities\n\n4. **Fractal/Recursive Opportunities**:\n   - Single-layer → Multi-layer → Hierarchical filtering\n   - Nested repository/submodule search\n   - Conversation thread traversal\n   - File include chains\n   - Web link following\n\n5. **Innovation Ideas**:\n   - Unified filtering language\n   - Composable filter pipelines\n   - Filter presets/profiles\n   - Interactive refinement mode\n   - Cross-tool result chaining\n   - Multi-level context expansion\n\n6. **Standardization Recommendations**:\n   - Priority 1: Critical inconsistencies (exclude, time, format)\n   - Priority 2: Feature gaps (stats, line numbers, context)\n   - Priority 3: Innovation experiments\n\n## Key Findings\n\n- **`--exclude`** is overloaded (means different things in different contexts)\n- **Time filtering** has 3+ different naming patterns\n- **Context expansion** varies from 1 option (symmetric) to 3 options (asymmetric)\n- **Extension shortcuts** follow a pattern but could be more fractal\n- **Multi-level filtering** exists but isn't fully exploited (4+ layers possible)\n- **Stats, line numbers, and highlighting** are missing from most tools\n\nThe document is ready for you to read and use as a reference for understanding the current patterns and planning future improvements! \uD83C\uDFAF"}
{"role":"user","content":"Thanks, now, i'm going to ask you to more deeply investigate each section in that file you just created, for each CLI, one by one. I (or you) may have updated that file already, so you should re-read it now, before going on. Then, for one CLI (this one: cycodgr), i want you to investigate cycodgr's command line options super precisely, and ensure that each of the sectsions in the catalog are accurately represented. I want you to make a single file version of the catalog layers 1-9 for just the cycodgr CLI. This isn't about 'recommendations' for it... it's only a factual cataloging of what it does. Include 'source code' evidence of your assertions, including line numbers from the parser/parsing (for positional args and nonpositional, for all options/args that control any aspects of the 9 layers...) and from the subsequent components that impact the process... that means that for each 'mechanism', you'll need to track the call stack/data flows of implications... I'm looking for both a 'documented' proof aspect of this, as well as an eventual (not for now, not for you to figure out at the moment) set of oppurtunities to improve performance, or 'consistency' across tools... but... for this request, and this conversation, only focus on the cycodgr CLI, it's args/options for the 9 conceptual layers we're discussing here, along with 'proof' ... In fact, I do want a single file for the cycodgr CLI, but, it won't contain all the details... it'll only contain the 'links' to other files you'll create for each layer, and proof... thus, there should be a cycodgr-filter-pipeline-catalog-README.md file in the docs folder with links to one file per 'command' for the cycodgr CLI (like in cycodmd, files/web search/run/etc., and in cycod config-list, mcp-list, etc..., and in cycodj, things like, but only list/journal/search) ... there will be a variable number of these per cli. then, for each of those verb(noun/verbs maybe) each to 9 files for the cycodgr-{noun/verb}-filtering-pipeline-catalog-layer-{y}.md (9 of those 1 thru 9, for each noun/verb for cycodgr cli, we're currently about to start layer 5), and 1 corresponding '-proof.md' for each of those layers (our current layer is layer 5). If the -catalog-README.md for each 'command' for cycodgr CLI isn't yet setup, create it now... Then, for each noun/verb in cycodgr CLI, create the 9 layer files and proof files as described. Each layer file should describe how that layer is implemented for that noun/verb in cycodgr CLI, with links to the proof file. Each proof file should contain detailed evidence from the source code, including line numbers and explanations of how the code implements the features of that layer for that noun/verb in cycodgr CLI. Make sure to cover all options/args that impact each layer. Once you've created all these files for cycodgr CLI for layer 5, ensure they are well-organized and linked properly in the README files."}

The same number of lines is shown before and after matched lines.\\n\\n### Applied to Code Search Only\\n\\nContext expansion is applied when searching **code files**, not when searching repositories. Repository search shows full metadata without line-level filtering.\\n\\n### Integration with Line Filtering\\n\\nContext expansion works in conjunction with Layer 3 (CONTENT FILTERING):\\n1. Lines matching the filter are identified\\n2. Context lines are added around each match\\n3. The expanded context is displayed with line numbers\\n\\n## Data Flow\\n\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\nSearchCommand.LinesBeforeAndAfter (property)\\n    \\u2193\\nProgram.HandleCodeSearchAsync()\\n    \\u2193\\nProgram.FormatAndOutputCodeResults()\\n    \\u2193\\nProgram.ProcessFileGroupAsync()\\n    \\u2193\\nLineHelpers.FilterAndExpandContext()\\n    \\u2193\\nDisplay output with context\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\n\\n## Where Applied\\n\\nContext expansion is applied in:\\n\\n1. **Code search** (\\u0060--file-contains\\u0060, \\u0060--contains\\u0060 with code results)\\n2. **File content display** (when fetching full file content from GitHub)\\n3. **Line filtering** (when \\u0060--line-contains\\u0060 patterns are specified)\\n\\nContext is NOT applied to:\\n- Repository metadata display\\n- File lists (\\u0060--format files\\u0060)\\n- URL lists (\\u0060--format urls\\u0060)\\n\\n## Source Code References\\n\\nFor detailed source code evidence, see:\\n- [Layer 5 Proof Document](cycodgr-search-filtering-pipeline-catalog-layer-5-proof.md)\\n\\nKey files:\\n- \\u0060src/cycodgr/CommandLineCommands/SearchCommand.cs\\u0060 - LinesBeforeAndAfter property\\n- \\u0060src/cycodgr/CommandLine/CycoGrCommandLineOptions.cs\\u0060 - Option parsing\\n- \\u0060src/cycodgr/Program.cs\\u0060 - Context application during output\\n- \\u0060src/common/Helpers/LineHelpers.cs\\u0060 - Context expansion algorithm\\n\\n## Interaction with Other Layers\\n\\n### Layer 3: CONTENT FILTERING\\nContext expansion is applied AFTER content filtering identifies matching lines. The filter determines which lines are \\u0022matches\\u0022, and context expansion adds lines around those matches.\\n\\n### Layer 6: DISPLAY CONTROL\\nThe display format affects how context is shown:\\n- \\u0060detailed\\u0060 format: Shows context with syntax highlighting\\n- \\u0060json\\u0060/\\u0060csv\\u0060 formats: Context is included in text match fragments\\n- \\u0060files\\u0060/\\u0060urls\\u0060 formats: No line-level context\\n\\n### Layer 8: AI PROCESSING\\nContext is included in the content passed to AI instructions, providing AI with surrounding code for better analysis.\\n\\n## Behavior Details\\n\\n### Overlapping Context Ranges\\n\\nWhen two matches are close together, their context windows may overlap. The implementation handles this by:\\n- Merging overlapping ranges\\n- Not duplicating lines\\n- Maintaining sequential line numbers\\n\\n### File Boundaries\\n\\nContext expansion respects file boundaries:\\n- Won\\u0027t show lines before line 1\\n- Won\\u0027t show lines after the last line of the file\\n\\n### Line Number Display\\n\\nWhen context is shown, line numbers are displayed:\\n- Matched lines are marked (typically with \\u0060*\\u0060 or highlighting)\\n- Context lines are shown with their actual line numbers\\n- Line numbers help locate the match in the original file\\n\\n## Example Output\\n\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060bash\\n$ cycodgr microsoft/terminal --file-contains \\u0022ConPTY\\u0022 --lines 2\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\n\\nOutput shows:\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\n## src/cascadia/TerminalCore/Terminal.cpp\\n\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060cpp\\n  145:     // Initialize the console pipe\\n* 146:     _hConPTYInput = ConPTY::CreatePipe();\\n  147:     if (_hConPTYInput == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)\\n  148:     {\\n  149:         return E_FAIL;\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\n\\nThe \\u0060*\\u0060 marker indicates line 146 is the match, with lines 145, 147-149 showing context (2 before, 2 after).\\n\\n## Default Behavior\\n\\nIf \\u0060--lines-before-and-after\\u0060 is not specified, the default is **5 lines** of context before and after each match.\\n\\nThis default provides a good balance between:\\n- Showing enough context to understand the match\\n- Not overwhelming users with too much code\\n- Reasonable output length for typical searches\\n\\n## Performance Considerations\\n\\nContext expansion happens AFTER:\\n- Files are downloaded from GitHub\\n- Content is filtered by patterns\\n- Matches are identified\\n\\nThis means context expansion does not affect:\\n- GitHub API calls\\n- Network bandwidth (beyond fetching matched files)\\n- Initial search performance\\n\\nThe performance impact is minimal as it\\u0027s a simple line extraction operation on already-fetched content.\\n\\n## Related Options\\n\\n- Layer 3: \\u0060--line-contains\\u0060 (filters which lines are matches)\\n- Layer 6: \\u0060--format\\u0060 (controls how context is displayed)\\n- Layer 8: \\u0060--file-instructions\\u0060 (AI processing includes context)\\n\\n---\\n\\n**For detailed source code evidence and line numbers, see**: [cycodgr-search-filtering-pipeline-catalog-layer-5-proof.md](cycodgr-search-filtering-pipeline-catalog-layer-5-proof.md)\\n\",\"path\":\"docs/cycodgr-search-filtering-pipeline-catalog-layer-5.md\"}"},"type":"function"}]}
