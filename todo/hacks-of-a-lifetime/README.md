# Hacks of a Lifetime

**Where we build the tools we wish existed.**

## What This Is

This is where we document building legitimately useful tools that solve real problems we have. Not toy examples, not tutorials - actual tools we'll use daily.

Each hack gets:
- **README.md** - The vision, architecture, and goals
- **journal/** - Our discovery process, problems, solutions, aha moments
- **docs/** - Research findings, API references, decisions
- **src/** - The actual working code

## Why Document Everything

Because the JOURNEY is as valuable as the DESTINATION.

When you see how we:
- Found reference code using cycodgr
- Learned unfamiliar APIs
- Solved tricky problems
- Made architectural decisions
- Debugged weird edge cases

You learn HOW to build, not just WHAT was built.

## Current Hacks

### [Smart PTY with Code Fence Renderer](./smart-pty-code-fence-renderer/)
**Status:** 🚀 Just Starting  
**Goal:** Terminal that automatically syntax-highlights code fences in ANY output  
**Why:** Because `cat README.md` should just WORK

More coming soon...

## The Philosophy

**"Scratch your own itch, then share the scratcher."**

Build what you need. Document how you built it. Help others build theirs.

That's how the best tools are born. 🔨
