## Key Information in Handoff

### Repo Studied
**JCWasmx86/GTKCssLanguageServer**
- Production Vala language server
- Uses manual tree traversal + custom AST
- ~1500 lines of AST code
- Good for LSP, overkill for highlighting

### Key Learnings

**1. Manual Traversal is Viable But Overkill** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Manual approach: 1500 lines
- Query approach: 20 lines
- Queries are CLEARLY superior for highlighting

**2. Visitor Pattern** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Elegant for AST analysis
- Not needed for query-based approach

**3. Vala = 8th Language Using Same C API** ⭐⭐
- All languages use same Tree-sitter C API
- Studying more bindings = waste of time

**4. Production Error Handling** ⭐⭐⭐
- Always check for null trees
- Fail gracefully

### P0 Questions Answered

**Q1: Parser init** ✅ 8th confirmation
- Same pattern in Vala as all other languages

**Q2: Parse code** ✅ 8th confirmation
- Same pattern

**Q3: Walk tree** ✅ 8th confirmation - NEW APPROACH
- Manual traversal discovered (1 repo)
- Queries still better (7 repos)
- **Queries win: 20 lines vs 1500 lines**

**Q4: Node → color** ⚠️ N/A (LSP, not highlighter)
- Still use ltreesitter's approach

**Q5: ANSI output** ⚠️ N/A (LSP uses JSON-RPC)
- Still use decoration table algorithm

### Next Repo

**❌ NO MORE REPOS!**

**10 reasons why:**
1. All P0 questions answered (8 times)
2. Perfect algorithm found (ltreesitter)
3. Perfect architecture found (knut)
4. Query approach validated (Session 8)
5. Working examples exist
6. Build strategy decided
7. 8 repos = substantial coverage
8. Session 6 proved bindings = waste
9. Session 7 confirmed we had everything
10. Session 8 validated queries > manual

**Next action:** 🚀 BUILD THE PROTOTYPE
