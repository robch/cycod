# Real-World API Usage Examples for Learning

## The Pitch

**"Learn any API by seeing how 100+ real projects actually use it - not toy examples from docs, but production code with full context. Filter by tech stack, find the patterns, save the best examples."**

This is the demo that makes developers go "I need this NOW."

## Why This Use Case is Killer

### Universal Appeal
Every developer learns new libraries constantly. This isn't situational - it's a daily need.

### Immediate Value
Results are directly copy-pasteable examples with real context showing:
- How to actually call the API
- Common patterns and edge cases
- Error handling that works
- Configuration that matters
- Integration with other libraries

### Shows All 3 Levels
1. **Repos** - Find projects using the library you're learning
2. **Files** - Narrow to code files that call the API
3. **Lines** - See the actual usage with surrounding context

### Emotional Hook
**Stop reading incomplete docs. See how 50 real projects ACTUALLY use it.**

Developers are tired of:
- Tutorial examples that don't handle edge cases
- Documentation that's outdated or incomplete
- Stack Overflow answers without full context
- Not knowing if they're doing it "the right way"

### Viral Potential
Developers will share: *"Holy shit, look at all these real examples of X! This beats docs by 10x!"*

### Non-Threatening
This isn't about:
- Fixing security vulnerabilities
- Migrating away from deprecated APIs
- Solving problems you don't have yet

It's about **learning and growing** - positive and exciting.

## Why It Beats the Alternatives

| Use Case | Pro | Con |
|----------|-----|-----|
| **API Learning** | Universal, constant need | Could seem like "just search" |
| Migration Patterns | High value when needed | Situational - only during migrations |
| Security Audit | Critical for enterprises | Scary/negative, narrow audience |
| K8s Patterns | Deep value for K8s users | Too narrow (only DevOps/Platform) |
| Deprecation Analysis | Important for maintenance | Reactive problem-solving |

## The Magic Formula

**Problem:** Docs are incomplete, examples are toy code, Stack Overflow is scattered

**Solution:** Three-level filtering across real production code

**Result:** Learn any API in minutes instead of hours

## Target Audience

- **Junior/Mid developers** learning new libraries (huge market)
- **Senior developers** evaluating new tech (decision makers)
- **Tech leads** researching architecture patterns (influencers)
- **Open source maintainers** seeing how their library is used (early adopters)

## The "Aha!" Moment

When a developer sees 50 real examples of how to use `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` with Anthropic in one query, with full context, filterable by pattern... they realize:

*"This is what search should have been all along."*

Not just finding the needle in the haystack - finding ALL the needles, organized by the haystack, with instructions on which haystack is best.

## Next: Find the Perfect Example

What API/library would resonate with "most devs"?

**Criteria:**
- Widely known but tricky to learn
- Has incomplete or confusing docs
- Used across multiple project types
- Recent enough to be relevant
- Complex enough to need examples

**Candidates:**
- Authentication (OAuth, JWT, etc.)
- HTTP clients (fetch, axios, HttpClient)
- Database ORMs (Entity Framework, Prisma, etc.)
- Async/await patterns
- Logging libraries
- Testing frameworks
- Configuration management
- Dependency injection

**The winner needs to make devs think:**
*"I struggled with this for HOURS. If I'd had this tool..."*
