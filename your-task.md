# YOUR TASK - TRACING FUNCTION CALL FLOW

## IMPORTANT FILES TO REFERENCE
- **Log file**: `cycod-log-for-me.log` (already present in the root directory)
- **Source code**: `CodeExplorationHelperFunctions.cs` containing the `SearchCodebaseForPattern` function
- **Search pattern**: `var [a-zA-Z]+\d =`

## OBJECTIVE
I need to trace and document the complete execution flow that happens when the `SearchCodebaseForPattern` function in `CodeExplorationHelperFunctions.cs` is called with the regex pattern `var [a-zA-Z]+\d =`. This involves tracking how control passes from one function to another, examining the logs generated at each step, and building a detailed map of the execution path.

## METHODOLOGY

For each function in the call chain, I will:

1. **Find the function** in the source code:
   - Use appropriate search tools but avoid regex patterns containing slashes
   - Limit searches to specific file types (e.g., `**/*.cs`)
   - Record line numbers for precise referencing

2. **Read and analyze the function code**:
   - Examine the full function implementation
   - Identify what it does and how it works
   - Locate where it calls the next function in the chain

3. **Examine logging statements**:
   - Identify all logging statements within the function
   - Note the format and content of log messages

4. **Find corresponding log entries**:
   - For cycod process: search in `cycod-log-for-me.log` (IMPORTANT: This file is already provided in the root directory)
   - For cycodmd process: find the latest log in `\users\r\.cycod\logs` folder
   - Use grep/findstr with output limiting to keep results under 1KB
   - Match log entries to the specific regex pattern search (`var [a-zA-Z]+\d =`)
   - Use commands like `grep -n "pattern" cycod-log-for-me.log | head -n 20` to find relevant entries

5. **Document findings** in a structured format:
   - Function details, code snippets, log entries
   - Clear indication of which function is called next
   - Any notable observations or anomalies

6. **Continue to the next function** in the execution path

This process will build a comprehensive understanding of how the code flows when searching for patterns in the codebase.

## CURRENT INVESTIGATION STATE

### Current Position
- Currently examining: Not started yet
- Target regex pattern: `var [a-zA-Z]+\d =`
- Primary log file: `cycod-log-for-me.log` (already available in the root directory)

### Execution Path Discovered So Far
1. [Not started yet]

### Key Log Entries
- [Not started yet]

### Critical Findings
- [Not started yet]

### Next Steps
1. Confirm cycod-log-for-me.log is in the root directory (DO NOT create a new log file)
2. Find SearchCodebaseForPattern in CodeExplorationHelperFunctions.cs
3. Examine its implementation
4. Identify logging statements
5. Find corresponding entries in cycod-log-for-me.log using grep/findstr commands

### Progress Checkpoint (For Recovery After Interruption)
- **Last completed action**: None
- **Current file being examined**: None
- **Line number reached**: N/A
- **Search in progress**: No
- **Commands executed**: None
- **Command about to execute**: None
- **Partial findings not yet documented**: None
- **Evidence collected but not analyzed**: None

## SEARCH TECHNIQUES THAT WORK
- [To be filled as techniques are validated]

## ERROR RECOVERY
If investigation was interrupted mid-function:
1. Check the Progress Checkpoint section above to determine where I left off
2. **VERIFY KEY FILES EXIST AND ARE ACCESSIBLE**
   - IMPORTANT: Confirm `cycod-log-for-me.log` is in the root directory
   - DO NOT attempt to recreate logs - use the provided log file
   - Verify that you're searching in the correct location for source code files
3. **IMPORTANT: Control data volume**
   - If previous command loaded too much data, modify approach to limit output
   - For log searches: Add stricter filters, use `head -n X` to limit lines, or `cut -c 1-Y` to limit line width
   - For file viewing: Request smaller chunks by using more restrictive line ranges
   - Consider using `wc -l` or `measure-object` first to check result size before viewing content
3. Re-execute commands with stricter limits:
   - Replace `grep pattern file` with `grep pattern file | head -n 10`
   - Replace `cat file` with `head -n 20 file` or targeted line ranges
   - Consider using `| cut -c 1-100` to truncate long lines
4. If examining a file, return to the specified line number but request fewer lines at once
5. Never read entire log files - always use filtering tools
6. If partial findings exist, evaluate and incorporate them before proceeding
7. Continue from the last completed action with adjusted, data-volume-aware commands
