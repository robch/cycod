# Function Calling

One of the most powerful features of CycoD is the ability for the AI assistant to call functions that can interact with your system. This document explains how function calling works in CycoD and the available functions.

## Available Functions

CycoD provides three main categories of functions that the AI assistant can use:

### Shell Command Functions

These functions allow the AI to execute commands in different shell environments:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `RunBashCommandAsync` | Run commands in a bash shell with persistent session |
| `RunCmdCommandAsync` | Run commands in a cmd shell (Windows) with persistent session |
| `RunPowershellCommandAsync` | Run commands in a PowerShell shell with persistent session |

Key features of shell command functions:

- Each function maintains a persistent session, so state (like environment variables) is maintained across multiple commands
- Sessions are automatically reset if a command times out (default timeout: 60 seconds)
- You can specify a custom timeout in milliseconds for long-running commands
- Error codes are captured and returned with output
- UTF-8 encoding is automatically set where possible

Example usage with timeout:
```
RunBashCommandAsync("find / -name '*.log'", 120000)  // 2 minute timeout
```

### File Operation Functions

These functions allow the AI to interact with the file system:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ListFiles` | List files and directories in a specified path (up to 2 levels deep) |
| `ViewFile` | View the contents of a file, optionally with line numbers and line range |
| `CreateFile` | Create a new file with specified content |
| `StrReplace` | Replace text in a file (only replaces unique occurrences) |
| `Insert` | Insert text at a specific line in a file |
| `UndoEdit` | Revert the last edit made to a file |

Key features of file operation functions:

- `ViewFile` supports viewing specific line ranges and adding line numbers
- `StrReplace` has built-in safety to only replace unique occurrences of text
- All file edits are tracked to support the `UndoEdit` function
- `ListFiles` handles relative and absolute paths and displays directories as such

### Time and Date Functions

Simple utility functions for getting current time information:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GetCurrentDate` | Returns the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format |
| `GetCurrentTime` | Returns the current time in HH:MM:SS format |

## How Function Calling Works

When the AI suggests using a function, the following process occurs:

1. The AI analyzes your request and determines a function should be called
2. CycoD interprets the function call and executes it with the provided parameters
3. The function result is sent back to the AI as a tool message
4. The AI continues its response, taking into account the function's output

Function calls are displayed in the terminal with function name, arguments, and results, so you can see what operations are being performed on your behalf.

## Example Usage

When using CycoD interactively, you can ask the AI to perform tasks that use these functions:

### Shell Command Example

User: 
```
Can you show me the current directory structure and then create a Python script that lists all files in the current directory?
```

The AI might use `RunBashCommandAsync` to run `ls -la` and then use `CreateFile` to create a Python script.

### File Operation Example

User:
```
Can you help me fix the syntax error in my JavaScript file at ./src/app.js?
```

The AI might use `ViewFile` to examine the code, identify errors, and then use `StrReplace` to fix them.

## Security Considerations

Since these functions can execute commands and modify files on your system, consider the following security precautions:

1. Be careful about the prompts you provide to the AI
2. Review suggested changes before confirming them
3. Don't use CycoD with elevated privileges unless necessary
4. Be cautious when allowing the AI to modify important files
5. Use the `--debug` flag to see detailed information about all function calls
6. Remember that persistent shell sessions remain active between commands

## Controlling Function Permissions

CycoD provides powerful control mechanisms for managing which functions the AI assistant can call without prompting you for permission. You can automatically approve or deny specific types of functions to streamline your workflow.

### Function Types

Functions in CycoD are categorized into three main types:

- **read**: Functions that read content (ViewFile, ListFiles, etc.)
- **write**: Functions that modify content (CreateFile, StrReplace, Insert, etc.)
- **run**: Functions that execute commands (RunBashCommandAsync, RunCmdCommandAsync, RunPowershellCommandAsync)

### Auto-Approve Options

The `--auto-approve` option allows you to automatically allow specific function calls without requiring permission each time:

```bash
cycod --auto-approve PATTERN1 [PATTERN2 [...]]
```

#### Pattern Types

You can use several types of patterns to control which functions are auto-approved:

- **Function name**: Approve a specific function (e.g., `ViewFile`)
- **Function type**: Approve all functions of a specific type (`read`, `write`, or `run`)
- **Wildcard**: Approve all functions using the asterisk (`*`)

#### Examples

```bash
# Auto-approve all read-only functions
cycod --auto-approve read

# Auto-approve specific functions
cycod --auto-approve ViewFile ListFiles

# Auto-approve file operations but not command execution
cycod --auto-approve read write

# Auto-approve all functions (use with caution)
cycod --auto-approve *
```

### Auto-Deny Options

The `--auto-deny` option allows you to automatically block specific function calls without prompting:

```bash
cycod --auto-deny PATTERN1 [PATTERN2 [...]]
```

#### Examples

```bash
# Auto-deny all command execution functions
cycod --auto-deny run

# Auto-deny specific functions
cycod --auto-deny CreateFile DeleteFile

# Auto-deny all write operations
cycod --auto-deny write
```

### Persisting Function Permissions

For a more permanent solution, you can configure function permissions using the config command:

#### Setting Auto-Approve Configuration

```bash
# Set auto-approve for read operations at user level
cycod config set App.AutoApprove read --user

# Set auto-approve for multiple function types at local level
cycod config set App.AutoApprove "read write" --local

# Auto-approve all functions system-wide (use with caution)
cycod config set App.AutoApprove "*" --global

# Auto-approve specific functions
cycod config set App.AutoApprove "ViewFile ListFiles" --user
```

#### Setting Auto-Deny Configuration

```bash
# Set auto-deny for command execution at user level
cycod config set App.AutoDeny run --user

# Set auto-deny for write operations
cycod config set App.AutoDeny write --local

# Auto-deny specific functions
cycod config set App.AutoDeny "CreateFile StrReplace" --global
```

#### Adding to Existing Lists

If you want to add values to existing auto-approve or auto-deny lists:

```bash
# Add an additional function type to auto-approve
cycod config add App.AutoApprove read
cycod config add App.AutoApprove write

# Add specific functions to auto-deny
cycod config add App.AutoDeny DeleteFile
cycod config add App.AutoDeny RunBashCommandAsync
```

#### Removing Values

```bash
# Remove a function or type from auto-approve list
cycod config remove App.AutoApprove write

# Remove a function from auto-deny list
cycod config remove App.AutoDeny DeleteFile
```

#### Clearing All Settings

```bash
# Clear all auto-approvals
cycod config clear App.AutoApprove

# Clear all auto-denials
cycod config clear App.AutoDeny
```

### Using Environment Variables

You can also set function permissions using environment variables:

```bash
# Windows
set CYCOD_AUTO_APPROVE=read write
set CYCOD_AUTO_DENY=run

# Linux/macOS
export CYCOD_AUTO_APPROVE="read write"
export CYCOD_AUTO_DENY="run"
```

### Permission Priority Rules

When multiple permission rules apply to the same function, the following priority rules are used:

1. Auto-deny takes precedence over auto-approve
2. Command-line options take precedence over configuration settings
3. If neither auto-approve nor auto-deny applies, CycoD will prompt you for permission

### Scope Considerations

When using `cycod config` to set permissions, consider which scope is appropriate:

- **Local** (`--local`): Apply only to the current directory
- **User** (`--user`): Apply to the current user across all directories
- **Global** (`--global`): Apply to all users system-wide

Choose the scope that matches your security requirements and workflow needs.
