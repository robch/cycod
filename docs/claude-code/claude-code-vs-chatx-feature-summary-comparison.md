# Claude Code vs CycoD: Feature Comparison Analysis

This is an analysis of the [cycod](https://github.com/robch/cycod/) codebase compared to [Anthropic's Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) feature by feature, along with a list of tasks to update cycod to have all of [Claude Code's capabilities](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/tutorials).

This comparison was done using [cycodmd](https://github.com/robch/cycodmd) and [cycod](https://github.com/robch/cycod/) to retrieve the [Claude Code Tutorials](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/tutorials) and compare them to the cycod codebase.

1. Use `cycodmd` to search for claude code tutorials on the web, and summarize in markdown:

   ```bash
   cycodmd web search "anthropic claude code tutorials" --get --strip --max 5 --instructions "Summarize in markdown, features of claude code terminal/console application, including brief tutorial on key features." --duckduckgo --interactive --save-chat-history "claude-code-tutorial-summary.jsonl"
   ```

2. Use `cycod` to compare claude code tutorials/summary to the cycod codebase, obtained using `cycodmd`:

   ```bash
   cycodmd src\**\*.cs | cycod --input-chat-history "claude-code-tutorial-summary.jsonl" --input - "See the feature summary for claude code? I want you to make a point by point comparison/analysis for claude code vs the cycod codebase you see here. At the end list the tasks to update the cycod codebase to have all the features that claude code has."
   ```

## Command Structure Comparison

### Basic CLI Interaction

**Claude Code:**
- `claude` - Interactive mode conversation
- `claude "query"` - Start with an initial query
- `claude -p "query"` - Non-interactive one-off queries

**CycoD:**
- `cycod` - Interactive mode conversation
- Supports direct input via arguments (similar to `claude "query"`)
- Uses `--input` and variations for non-interactive queries, but lacks a direct equivalent to `-p` flag

### Configuration Management

**Claude Code:**
- `claude config` with subcommands (list, get, set, add, remove)
- Global vs project-level configuration
- Rich settings ecosystem

**CycoD:**
- Complete `cycod config` command system with equivalent subcommands:
  - `config get` - Retrieve configuration values

  - `config list` - List all configuration values with source attribution
  - `config add` - Add values to a list setting
  - `config remove` - Remove values from a list setting
  - `config clear` - Clear configuration values
- Hierarchical configuration with multiple scopes:
  - Global scope (system-wide settings)
  - User scope (user-specific settings)
  - Local scope (project/directory-specific settings)
  - File-specific scope
  - Command-line settings (highest priority)
- Sophisticated configuration system with clear precedence rules:
  - Command line > Environment Variables > Explicit Config Files > Project-level > User-level > Global > Defaults
- Rich configuration value handling with source tracking and type support
- Supports multiple configuration file formats (YAML and INI)
- Platform-aware configuration paths (Windows/Linux/Mac)
- Special handling for secret values with obfuscation
- Uses the `--save-alias` system for reusable configurations

### Input/Output Handling
