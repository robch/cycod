I'll format the Claude Code overview document as markdown.

# Claude Code overview - Anthropic

## Introduction

Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster through natural language commands. By integrating directly with your development environment, Claude Code streamlines your workflow without requiring additional servers or complex setup.

### Research preview

Code is in beta as a research preview. We're gathering developer feedback on AI collaboration preferences, which workflows benefit most from AI assistance, and how to improve the agent experience.

This early version will evolve based on user feedback. We plan to enhance tool execution reliability, support for long-running commands, terminal rendering, and Claude's self-knowledge of its capabilities in the coming weeks.

Report bugs directly with the `/bug` command or through our GitHub repository.

## Before you begin

### Check system requirements

- **Operating Systems**: macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 20.04+/Debian 10+, or Windows via WSL
- **Hardware**: 4GB RAM minimum
- **Software**:
  - Node.js 18+
  - git 2.23+ (optional)
  - GitHub or GitLab CLI for PR workflows (optional)
  - ripgrep (rg) for enhanced file search (optional)
- **Network**: Internet connection required for authentication and AI processing
- **Location**: Available only in supported countries

#### Troubleshooting WSL installation

Currently, Claude Code does not run directly in Windows, and instead requires WSL. If you encounter issues in WSL:

- **OS/platform detection issues**: If you receive an error during installation, WSL may be using Windows npm. Try:
  - Run `npm config set os linux` before installation
  - Install with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --force --no-os-check` (Do NOT use sudo)
- **Node not found errors**: If you see `exec: node: not found` when running claude, your WSL environment may be using a Windows installation of Node.js. You can confirm this with `which npm` and `which node`, which should point to Linux paths starting with `/usr/` rather than `/mnt/c/`. To fix this, try installing Node via your Linux distribution's package manager or via nvm.

### Install and authenticate

1. **Install Claude Code**
   Run in your terminal: 
   ```
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```
   Do NOT use `sudo npm install -g` as this can lead to permission issues and security risks. If you encounter permission errors, see configure Claude Code for recommended solutions.

2. **Navigate to your project**
   ```
   cd your-project-directory
   ```

3. **Start Claude Code**
   Run `claude` to launch

4. **Complete authentication**
   Follow the one-time OAuth process with your Console account. You'll need active billing at console.anthropic.com.

## Core features and workflows

Claude Code operates directly in your terminal, understanding your project context and taking real actions. No need to manually add files to context - Claude will explore your codebase as needed. Claude Code uses claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 by default.

### Security and privacy by design

Your code's security is paramount. Claude Code's architecture ensures:

- **Direct API connection**: Your queries go straight to Anthropic's API without intermediate servers
- **Works where you work**: Operates directly in your terminal
- **Understands context**: Maintains awareness of your entire project structure
- **Takes action**: Performs real operations like editing files and creating commits

### From questions to solutions in seconds

```
# Ask questions about your codebase
claude
> how does our authentication system work?
# Create a commit with one command
claude commit
# Fix issues across multiple files
claude "fix the type errors in the auth module"
```

### Initialize your project

For first-time users, we recommend:

1. Start Claude Code with `claude`
2. Try a simple command like `summarize this project`
3. Generate a CLAUDE.md project guide with `/init`
4. Ask Claude to commit the generated CLAUDE.md file to your repository

### Use Claude Code for common tasks

Claude Code operates directly in your terminal, understanding your project context and taking real actions. No need to manually add files to context - Claude will explore your codebase as needed.

#### Understand unfamiliar code

```
> what does the payment processing system do?
> find where user permissions are checked
> explain how the caching layer works
```

#### Automate Git operations

```
> commit my changes
> create a pr
> which commit added tests for markdown back in December?
> rebase on main and resolve any merge conflicts
```

#### Edit code intelligently

```
> add input validation to the signup form
> refactor the logger to use the new API
> fix the race condition in the worker queue
```

#### Test and debug your code

```
> run tests for the auth module and fix failures
> find and fix security vulnerabilities
> explain why this test is failing
```

### Encourage deeper thinking

For complex problems, explicitly ask Claude to think more deeply:

```
> think about how we should architect the new payment service
> think hard about the edge cases in our authentication flow
```

Claude Code will show when Claude (3.7 Sonnet) is using extended thinking. You can proactively prompt Claude to "think" or "think deeply" for more planning-intensive tasks. We suggest that you first tell Claude about your task and let it gather context from your project. Then, ask it to "think" to create a plan.

Claude will think more based on the words you use. For example, "think hard" will trigger more extended thinking than saying "think" alone. For more tips, see Extended thinking tips.

### Automate CI and infra workflows

Claude Code comes with a non-interactive mode for headless execution. This is especially useful for running Claude Code in non-interactive contexts like scripts, pipelines, and Github Actions.

Use `--print` (`-p`) to run Claude in non-interactive mode. In this mode, you can set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable to provide a custom API key.

Non-interactive mode is especially useful when you pre-configure the set of commands Claude is allowed to use:

```
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk_...
claude -p "update the README with the latest changes" --allowedTools "Bash(git diff:*)" "Bash(git log:*)" Edit
```

## Control Claude Code with commands

### CLI commands

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| claude | Start interactive REPL | `claude` |
| claude "query" | Start REPL with initial prompt | `claude "explain this project"` |
| claude -p "query" | Run one-off query, then exit | `claude -p "explain this function"` |
| cat file \| claude -p "query" | Process piped content | `cat logs.txt \| claude -p "explain"` |
| claude config | Configure settings | `claude config set --global theme dark` |
| claude update | Update to latest version | `claude update` |
| claude mcp | Configure Model Context Protocol servers | See MCP section in tutorials |

CLI flags:
- `--print` (`-p`): Print response without interactive mode
- `--json`: Return JSON output in `--print` mode, useful for scripting and automation
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose logging, shows full turn-by-turn output (helpful for debugging in both print and interactive modes)
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions`: Skip permission prompts

### Slash commands

Control Claude's behavior within a session:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| /bug | Report bugs (sends conversation to Anthropic) |
| /clear | Clear conversation history |
| /compact [instructions] | Compact conversation with optional focus instructions |
| /config | View/modify configuration |
| /cost | Show token usage statistics |
| /doctor | Checks the health of your Claude Code installation |
| /help | Get usage help |
| /init | Initialize project with CLAUDE.md guide |
| /login | Switch Anthropic accounts |
| /logout | Sign out from your Anthropic account |
| /memory | Edit CLAUDE.md memory files |
| /pr_comments | View pull request comments |
| /review | Request code review |
| /terminal-setup | Install Shift+Enter key binding for newlines (iTerm2 and VSCode only) |
| /vim | Enter vim mode for alternating insert and command modes |

## Manage Claude's memory

Claude Code can remember your preferences across sessions, like style guidelines and common commands in your workflow.

### Determine memory type

Claude Code offers three memory locations, each serving a different purpose:

| Memory Type | Location | Purpose | Use Case Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Project memory | ./CLAUDE.md | Team-shared conventions and knowledge | Project architecture, coding standards, common workflows |
| Project memory (local) | ./CLAUDE.local.md | Personal project-specific preferences | Your sandbox URLs, preferred test data |
| User memory | ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md | Global personal preferences | Code styling preferences, personal tooling shortcuts |

All memory files are automatically loaded into Claude Code's context when launched.

### How Claude looks up memories

Claude Code reads memories recursively: starting in the cwd, Claude Code recurses up to / and reads any CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md files it finds. This is especially convenient when working in large repositories where you run Claude Code in foo/bar/, and have memories in both foo/CLAUDE.md and foo/bar/CLAUDE.md.

### Quickly add memories with the # shortcut

The fastest way to add a memory is to start your input with the # character:

```
# Always use descriptive variable names
```

You'll be prompted to select which memory file to store this in.

### Directly edit memories with /memory

Use the `/memory` slash command during a session to open any memory file in your system editor for more extensive additions or organization.

### Memory best practices

- Be specific: "Use 2-space indentation" is better than "Format code properly".
- Use structure to organize: Format each individual memory as a bullet point and group related memories under descriptive markdown headings.
- Review periodically: Update memories as your project evolves to ensure Claude is always using the most up to date information and context.

## Manage permissions and security

Claude Code uses a tiered permission system to balance power and safety:

| Tool Type | Example | Approval Required | "Yes, don't ask again" Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Read-only | File reads, LS, Grep | No | N/A |
| Bash Commands | Shell execution | Yes | Permanently per project directory and command |
| File Modification | Edit/write files | Yes | Until session end |

### Tools available to Claude

Claude Code has access to a set of powerful tools that help it understand and modify your codebase:

| Tool | Description | Permission Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AgentTool | Runs a sub-agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks | No |
| BashTool | Executes shell commands in your environment | Yes |
| GlobTool | Finds files based on pattern matching | No |
| GrepTool | Searches for patterns in file contents | No |
| LSTool | Lists files and directories | No |
| FileReadTool | Reads the contents of files | No |
| FileEditTool | Makes targeted edits to specific files | Yes |
| FileWriteTool | Creates or overwrites files | Yes |
| NotebookReadTool | Reads and displays Jupyter notebook contents | No |
| NotebookEditTool | Modifies Jupyter notebook cells | Yes |

### Protect against prompt injection

Prompt injection is a technique where an attacker attempts to override or manipulate an AI assistant's instructions by inserting malicious text. Claude Code includes several safeguards against these attacks:

- Permission system: Sensitive operations require explicit approval
- Context-aware analysis: Detects potentially harmful instructions by analyzing the full request
- Input sanitization: Prevents command injection by processing user inputs
- Command blocklist: Blocks risky commands that fetch arbitrary content from the web like curl and wget

Best practices for working with untrusted content:
- Review suggested commands before approval
- Avoid piping untrusted content directly to Claude
- Verify proposed changes to critical files
- Report suspicious behavior with `/bug`

While these protections significantly reduce risk, no system is completely immune to all attacks. Always maintain good security practices when working with any AI tool.

### Configure network access

Claude Code requires access to:
- api.anthropic.com
- statsig.anthropic.com
- sentry.io

Allowlist these URLs when using Claude Code in containerized environments.

### Environment variables

Claude Code supports the following environment variables to control its behavior:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER | Set to 1 to disable the automatic updater |
| DISABLE_BUG_COMMAND | Set to 1 to disable the `/bug` command |
| DISABLE_COST_WARNINGS | Set to 1 to disable cost warning messages |
| HTTP_PROXY | Specify HTTP proxy server for network connections |
| HTTPS_PROXY | Specify HTTPS proxy server for network connections |
| MCP_TIMEOUT | Timeout in milliseconds for MCP server startup |
| MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT | Timeout in milliseconds for MCP tool execution |

## Configure Claude Code

Configure Claude Code by running `claude config` in your terminal, or the `/config` command when using the interactive REPL.

### Configuration options

Claude Code supports global and project-level configuration.

To manage your configurations, use the following commands:
- List settings: `claude config list`
- See a setting: `claude config get <key>`
- Change a setting: `claude config set <key> <value>`
- Push to a setting (for lists): `claude config add <key> <value>`
- Remove from a setting (for lists): `claude config remove <key> <value>`

By default config changes your project configuration. To manage your global configuration, use the `--global` (or `-g`) flag.

### Global configuration

To set a global configuration, use `claude config set -g <key> <value>`:

| Key | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| autoUpdaterStatus | disabled or enabled | Enable or disable the auto-updater (default: enabled) |
| env | JSON (eg. '{"FOO": "bar"}') | Environment variables that will be applied to every session |
| preferredNotifChannel | iterm2, iterm2_with_bell, terminal_bell, or notifications_disabled | Where you want to receive notifications (default: iterm2) |
| theme | dark, light, light-daltonized, or dark-daltonized | Color theme |
| verbose | true or false | Whether to show full bash and command outputs (default: false) |

### Auto-updater permission options

When Claude Code detects that it doesn't have sufficient permissions to write to your global npm prefix directory (required for automatic updates), you'll see a warning that points to this documentation page. For detailed solutions to auto-updater issues, see the troubleshooting guide.

#### Recommended: Create a new user-writable npm prefix

```
# First, save a list of your existing global packages for later migration
npm list -g --depth=0 > ~/npm-global-packages.txt
# Create a directory for your global packages
mkdir -p ~/.npm-global
# Configure npm to use the new directory path
npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global
# Note: Replace ~/.bashrc with ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile, or other appropriate file for your shell
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
# Apply the new PATH setting
source ~/.bashrc
# Now reinstall Claude Code in the new location
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
# Optional: Reinstall your previous global packages in the new location
# Look at ~/npm-global-packages.txt and install packages you want to keep
# npm install -g package1 package2 package3...
```

Why we recommend this option:
- Avoids modifying system directory permissions
- Creates a clean, dedicated location for your global npm packages
- Follows security best practices

Since Claude Code is actively developing, we recommend setting up auto-updates using the recommended option above.

#### Disabling the auto-updater

If you prefer to disable the auto-updater instead of fixing permissions, you can use:

```
claude config set -g autoUpdaterStatus disabled
```

### Project configuration

Manage project configuration with `claude config set <key> <value>` (without the `-g` flag):

| Key | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| allowedTools | array of tools | Which tools can run without manual approval |
| ignorePatterns | array of glob strings | Which files/directories are ignored when using tools |

For example:

```
# Let npm test to run without approval
claude config add allowedTools "Bash(npm test)"
# Let npm test and any of its sub-commands to run without approval
claude config add allowedTools "Bash(npm test:*)"
# Instruct Claude to ignore node_modules
claude config add ignorePatterns node_modules
claude config add ignorePatterns "node_modules/**"
```

## Optimize your terminal setup

Claude Code works best when your terminal is properly configured. Follow these guidelines to optimize your experience.

Supported shells:
- Bash
- Zsh
- Fish

### Themes and appearance

Claude cannot control the theme of your terminal. That's handled by your terminal application. You can match Claude Code's theme to your terminal during onboarding or any time via the `/config` command

### Line breaks

You have several options for entering linebreaks into Claude Code:
- Quick escape: Type \ followed by Enter to create a newline
- Keyboard shortcut: Press Option+Enter (Meta+Enter) with proper configuration

To set up Option+Enter in your terminal:

For Mac Terminal.app:
- Open Settings → Profiles → Keyboard
- Check "Use Option as Meta Key"

For iTerm2 and VSCode terminal:
- Open Settings → Profiles → Keys
- Under General, set Left/Right Option key to "Esc+"

Tip for iTerm2 and VSCode users: Run `/terminal-setup` within Claude Code to automatically configure Shift+Enter as a more intuitive alternative.

### Notification setup

Never miss when Claude completes a task with proper notification configuration:

**Terminal bell notifications**

Enable sound alerts when tasks complete:
```
claude config set --global preferredNotifChannel terminal_bell
```

For macOS users: Don't forget to enable notification permissions in System Settings → Notifications → [Your Terminal App].

**iTerm 2 system notifications**

For iTerm 2 alerts when tasks complete:
1. Open iTerm 2 Preferences
2. Navigate to Profiles → Terminal
3. Enable "Silence bell" and "Send notification when idle"
4. Set your preferred notification delay

Note that these notifications are specific to iTerm 2 and not available in the default macOS Terminal.

### Handling large inputs

When working with extensive code or long instructions:
- Avoid direct pasting: Claude Code may struggle with very long pasted content
- Use file-based workflows: Write content to a file and ask Claude to read it
- Be aware of VS Code limitations: The VS Code terminal is particularly prone to truncating long pastes

### Vim Mode

Claude Code supports a subset of Vim keybindings that can be enabled with `/vim` or configured via `/config`.

The supported subset includes:
- Mode switching: Esc (to NORMAL), i/I, a/A, o/O (to INSERT)
- Navigation: h/j/k/l, w/e/b, 0/$/^, gg/G
- Editing: x, dw/de/db/dd/D, cw/ce/cb/cc/C, . (repeat)

## Manage costs effectively

Claude Code consumes tokens for each interaction. The average cost is $6 per developer per day, with daily costs remaining below $12 for 90% of users.

### Track your costs

- Use `/cost` to see current session usage
- Check historical usage in the Anthropic Console. Note: Users need Admin or Billing roles to view Cost tab
- Set workspace spend limits for the Claude Code workspace. Note: Users need Admin role to set spend limits.

### Reduce token usage

**Compact conversations:**
- Claude uses auto-compact by default when context exceeds 95% capacity
- Toggle auto-compact: Run `/config` and navigate to "Auto-compact enabled"
- Use `/compact` manually when context gets large
- Add custom instructions: `/compact Focus on code samples and API usage`

Customize compaction by adding to CLAUDE.md:
```
# Summary instructions
When you are using compact, please focus on test output and code changes
```

- Write specific queries: Avoid vague requests that trigger unnecessary scanning
- Break down complex tasks: Split large tasks into focused interactions
- Clear history between tasks: Use `/clear` to reset context

Costs can vary significantly based on:
- Size of codebase being analyzed
- Complexity of queries
- Number of files being searched or modified
- Length of conversation history
- Frequency of compacting conversations

For team deployments, we recommend starting with a small pilot group to establish usage patterns before wider rollout.

## Model configuration

By default, Claude Code uses claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219. You can override this using the following environment variables:

```
# Anthropic API
ANTHROPIC_MODEL='claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219'
ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022'
# Amazon Bedrock
ANTHROPIC_MODEL='us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0'
ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL='us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0'
# Google Vertex AI
ANTHROPIC_MODEL='claude-3-7-sonnet@20250219'
ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL='claude-3-5-haiku@20241022'
```

You can also set these variables using the global configuration:

```
# Configure for Anthropic API
claude config set --global env '{"ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"}'
# Configure for Bedrock
claude config set --global env '{"CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK": "true", "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0"}'
# Configure for Vertex AI
claude config set --global env '{"CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX": "true", "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "claude-3-7-sonnet@20250219"}'
```

See our model names reference for all available models across different providers.

## Use with third-party APIs

Claude Code requires access to both Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Haiku models, regardless of which API provider you use.

### Connect to Amazon Bedrock

```
CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
```

If you'd like to access Claude Code via proxy, you can use the ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL environment variable:

```
ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL='https://your-proxy-url'
```

If you don't have prompt caching enabled, also set:

```
DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING=1
```

Requires standard AWS SDK credentials (e.g., ~/.aws/credentials or relevant environment variables like AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY). To set up AWS credentials, run:

```
aws configure
```

Contact Amazon Bedrock for prompt caching for reduced costs and higher rate limits.

Users will need access to both Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Haiku models in their AWS account. If you have a model access role, you may need to request access to these models if they're not already available. Access to Bedrock in each region is necessary because inference profiles require cross-region capability.

### Connect to Google Vertex AI

```
CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1
CLOUD_ML_REGION=us-east5
ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

If you'd like to access Claude Code via proxy, you can use the ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL environment variable:

```
ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL='https://your-proxy-url'
```

If you don't have prompt caching enabled, also set:

```
DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING=1
```

Claude Code on Vertex AI currently only supports the us-east5 region. Make sure your project has quota allocated in this specific region.

Users will need access to both Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Haiku models in their Vertex AI project.

Requires standard GCP credentials configured through google-auth-library. To set up GCP credentials, run:

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

For the best experience, contact Google for heightened rate limits.

### Connect though a proxy

When using Claude Code with an LLM proxy (like LiteLLM), you can control authentication behavior using the following environment variables and configs. Note that you can mix and match these with Bedrock and Vertex-specific settings.

#### Environment variables

- ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN: Custom value for the Authorization and Proxy-Authorization headers (the value you set here will be prefixed with Bearer )
- ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS: Custom headers you want to add to the request (in Name: Value format)
- HTTP_PROXY: Set the HTTP proxy URL
- HTTPS_PROXY: Set the HTTPS proxy URL

If you prefer to configure via a file instead of environment variables, you can add any of these variables to the env object in your global Claude config (in ~/.claude.json).

#### Global configuration options

- apiKeyHelper: A custom shell script to get an API key (invoked once at startup, and cached for the duration of each session)

## Development container reference implementation

Claude Code provides a development container configuration for teams that need consistent, secure environments. This preconfigured devcontainer setup works seamlessly with VS Code's Remote - Containers extension and similar tools.

The container's enhanced security measures (isolation and firewall rules) allow you to run claude --dangerously-skip-permissions to bypass permission prompts for unattended operation. We've included a reference implementation that you can customize for your needs.

While the devcontainer provides substantial protections, no system is completely immune to all attacks. Always maintain good security practices and monitor Claude's activities.

### Key features

- Production-ready Node.js: Built on Node.js 20 with essential development dependencies
- Security by design: Custom firewall restricting network access to only necessary services
- Developer-friendly tools: Includes git, ZSH with productivity enhancements, fzf, and more
- Seamless VS Code integration: Pre-configured extensions and optimized settings
- Session persistence: Preserves command history and configurations between container restarts
- Works everywhere: Compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux development environments

### Getting started in 4 steps

1. Install VS Code and the Remote - Containers extension
2. Clone the Claude Code reference implementation repository
3. Open the repository in VS Code
4. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" (or use Command Palette: Cmd+Shift+P → "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container")

### Configuration breakdown

The devcontainer setup consists of three primary components:
- devcontainer.json: Controls container settings, extensions, and volume mounts
- Dockerfile: Defines the container image and installed tools
- init-firewall.sh: Establishes network security rules

### Security features

The container implements a multi-layered security approach with its firewall configuration:
- Precise access control: Restricts outbound connections to whitelisted domains only (npm registry, GitHub, Anthropic API, etc.)
- Default-deny policy: Blocks all other external network access
- Startup verification: Validates firewall rules when the container initializes
- Isolation: Creates a secure development environment separated from your main system

### Customization options

The devcontainer configuration is designed to be adaptable to your needs:
- Add or remove VS Code extensions based on your workflow
- Modify resource allocations for different hardware environments
- Adjust network access permissions
- Customize shell configurations and developer tooling
