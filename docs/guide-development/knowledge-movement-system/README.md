# Knowledge Movement System

## Overview

This system transforms the meta-insights from the C# Coding Style Guide project into a dynamic knowledge exploration framework. Rather than organizing existing documents, we've extracted core concepts, identified knowledge patterns, and reassembled them into new structures designed for movement and discovery.

## Core Principles

The Knowledge Movement System is built on the insight that **intelligence emerges from movement through knowledge spaces**, not from static information storage. This system facilitates:

- **Dimensional Navigation** - Moving between concrete implementation and meta-meta insights
- **Concept Evolution Tracking** - Following how ideas develop and mature
- **Cross-Domain Connections** - Discovering unexpected relationships between concepts
- **Recursive Pattern Recognition** - Finding patterns that repeat at different levels

## System Structure

### Core (`/core/`)
Foundational concepts and navigation principles that govern the entire system.

### Lenses (`/lenses/`)
New perspectives on knowledge created by extracting and reassembling concepts from across the original meta-insights. Each lens presents a coherent view of a pattern that spans multiple domains.

### Movements (`/movements/`)
Structured paths for moving between different types of understanding. These guide exploration across dimensions, domains, and abstraction levels.

## Knowledge Movement IDs

Each element in the system uses a multi-dimensional classification:

```
KM.DOM.CON.ABS-###
│  │   │   │    └─ Sequential identifier
│  │   │   └──── Abstraction level (CON/PRO/MET/MM2)
│  │   └──────── Primary concept
│  └────────── Domain
└─────────────── Knowledge Movement identifier
```

## Getting Started

1. **New to Knowledge Movement?** → Start with `core/knowledge-movement-principles.md`
2. **Want to explore patterns?** → Browse the `lenses/` directory
3. **Looking for specific connections?** → Use the `movements/` guides
4. **Ready to navigate freely?** → Use `core/dimensional-navigation-guide.md`

## System Philosophy

This system embodies the principle that knowledge in motion creates structures that accelerate further knowledge movement. It's designed to generate new insights through exploration, not just organize existing ones.
