# Knowledge Movement ID System
**ID**: KM.IDS.STR.PRO-003

## Overview

The Knowledge Movement ID System provides multi-dimensional classification for concepts, patterns, and insights within the Knowledge Movement System. Like the test ID system that inspired it, this system encodes essential information in a compact, human-readable format that supports both sorting and understanding.

## Usage Guidelines

### For Document Classification
1. **Identify Primary Domain** - What area does this content primarily address?
2. **Determine Concept Category** - What type of concept is being discussed?
3. **Assess Abstraction Level** - How abstract vs concrete is the content?
4. **Assign Sequential Number** - Based on development stage and related concepts

### For Navigation Support
- **Sort by Domain** to explore all concepts in an area
- **Sort by Concept** to see patterns across domains
- **Sort by Abstraction** to move between concrete and meta levels
- **Sort by Sequential** to see developmental progression

### For Pattern Recognition
- **Same Domain/Concept, Different Abstraction**: Shows concept development
- **Same Concept, Different Domains**: Shows pattern transfer
- **Same Abstraction, Different Concepts**: Shows level-appropriate thinking
- **Sequential Patterns**: Shows systematic development within categories

## Benefits of This System

### Multi-Dimensional Classification
Encodes four important dimensions in compact format, enabling sophisticated sorting and filtering.

### Human-Readable Interpretation
IDs can be understood without reference documents, making system accessible and intuitive.

### Progressive Information Disclosure
Most important classification (domain) appears first, with increasing specificity from left to right.

### Scalable Organization
System handles growth from dozens to hundreds of concepts without becoming unwieldy.

### Pattern Recognition Support
Similar IDs indicate related concepts, making patterns visible through classification itself.

### Navigation Enhancement
IDs provide multiple entry points and pathways for knowledge exploration.

## Implementation Notes

### ID Assignment Process
1. **Content Analysis**: Understand what the concept or document contains
2. **Dimensional Classification**: Determine position in each dimension
3. **Sequential Placement**: Find appropriate sequential number within category
4. **Validation**: Ensure ID accurately represents content and fits system patterns

### Consistency Maintenance
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review ID assignments for consistency
- **Pattern Monitoring**: Watch for emerging patterns that might suggest new categories
- **System Evolution**: Allow system to evolve as knowledge grows and patterns emerge
- **Cross-Reference Checking**: Ensure related concepts have appropriately related IDs

## Connection Points

This system supports:
- **Dimensional Navigation** (KM.KMS.NAV.PRO-002) - IDs provide navigation waypoints
- **Pattern Recognition Systems** (KM.KMS.REC.MET-501) - IDs make patterns visible
- **Knowledge Movement Principles** (KM.KMS.FND.MET-001) - IDs facilitate knowledge movement
