# C# Expanded Guide Development Plan

## Overall Approach
- Using "Arcs and Sparks of Knowledge" (ASK) framework to guide development
- Progressive disclosure model with layered documentation
- **Using concrete analogies to make complex topics accessible**
- Balanced coverage for both newer and experienced developers

## Current Focus: Next Section Selection
**Status:** Planning phase

**Key decisions:**
- Four sections now completed with strong analogies
- Need to decide on next priority section to develop
- Will continue balanced approach for different experience levels

**Next steps:**
- Evaluate remaining sections from Essential guide
- Select next high-priority section for development
- Develop appropriate analogy for selected section

## Completed Sections
1. ✅ Asynchronous Programming (restaurant kitchen analogy)
2. ✅ Exception Handling and Error Returns (hospital emergency response system analogy)
3. ✅ Null Handling (cooking & recipe analogy)
4. ✅ LINQ (assembly line analogy)

## Next Priority Sections

Based on our analogy evaluation framework and consideration of junior developer needs:

1. **Variables and Types (Section 1)**
   - **Selected Analogy:** Container Storage System
   - **Key Mapping:** Variables = labeled containers, Types = container specifications
   - **Evaluation Score:** 46/50 (highest universal familiarity and visual clarity)

2. **Control Flow (Section 3)**
   - **Selected Analogy:** Road/Traffic System
   - **Key Mapping:** Code paths = roads, If statements = intersections, Loops = roundabouts
   - **Evaluation Score:** 46/50 (universally understood with clear visual mapping)

3. **Class Design and Relationships (Section 22)**
   - **Selected Analogy:** Building Architecture
   - **Key Mapping:** Classes = blueprints, Inheritance = shared foundations, Interfaces = standardized connections
   - **Evaluation Score:** 42/50 (avoids domain overlap with existing analogies)

## Timeline & Milestones
- ✅ Complete async programming section (restaurant kitchen analogy)
- ✅ Complete exception handling section (hospital emergency response system)
- ✅ Complete null handling section (cooking & recipe analogy)
- ✅ Complete LINQ section (assembly line analogy)
- ⏩ Develop Variables and Types section (container storage system analogy)
- ⏩ Develop Control Flow section (road/traffic system analogy)
- ⏩ Develop Class Design and Relationships section (building architecture analogy)
- Continue using strong analogies for complex topics

## Learnings & Insights
- Concrete analogies are extremely effective for making complex topics accessible
- Universal experiences (like cooking) create stronger mental models than abstract examples
- Completely separate domains avoid confusion with actual codebase
- Analogies work best when relationships between concepts match the technical relationships

## Staging Process
- Completed sections are stored in our "warmer": [sections-ready-for-integration.md](sections-ready-for-integration.md)
- Meta insights on analogy development: [concrete-analogies.md](meta-insights/concrete-analogies.md)
