# ASK Framework Notes

## Core Concept
The ASK (Arcs and Sparks of Knowledge) framework provides a structure for thinking about knowledge development and communication:

- **Sparks**: Initial ideas, inspirations, or insights that initiate exploration
- **Arcs**: Processes and structured paths that develop these sparks (discover, shape, refine)
- **Knowledge**: The outcomes, learnings, and growth that result

## Application to Documentation
- Documentation benefits from both structured progression (arcs) and creative insights (sparks)
- The framework acknowledges both planning and spontaneous discovery
- It creates space for recursive exploration while maintaining direction

## Fractal Nature
- Each arc can contain its own sparks, arcs, and knowledge outcomes
- We can "zoom in" to explore details or "zoom out" to see patterns
- This multi-dimensional approach allows for both depth and perspective

## ASK Applied to Analogy Development
Our experience developing analogies for technical concepts demonstrated the ASK framework in action:

- **Spark**: The initial idea to use analogies (kitchen for async, hospital for exceptions)
- **Arc 1: Discovery** - Exploring different possible analogies and mapping technical concepts
- **Arc 2: Shaping** - Developing the analogy structure and testing its completeness
- **Arc 3: Refinement** - Iterating based on feedback to improve consistency and coverage
- **Knowledge**: Both the completed analogies and meta-insights about effective analogy development

The framework helped us balance creativity with structure, resulting in more effective explanations.

## Framework Evolution Insights
- The "ready to serve" criteria represent an evolution of the ASK framework for quality control
- "Popping out" to capture meta-learnings is a manifestation of the fractal nature of ASK
- Hybrid approaches (like combining medical and safety domains) emerge naturally when arcs of different domains intersect

## Open Questions
- How might we visualize ASK framework processes?
- What metrics could help us evaluate the effectiveness of this approach?
- How does this framework interact with different learning styles?
- How can we better capture the transition points between sparks and arcs?
