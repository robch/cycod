# Unit Test Ideas for `parallelize` Attribute

## Basic Functionality Tests

```yaml
- name: Parallel execution of tests
  tests:
    - name: Test 1 - Parallel
      command: sleep 2 && echo "Test 1 done"
      parallelize: true
      expect-regex: Test 1 done
    
    - name: Test 2 - Parallel
      command: sleep 2 && echo "Test 2 done"
      parallelize: true
      expect-regex: Test 2 done
    
    - name: Test 3 - Parallel
      command: sleep 2 && echo "Test 3 done" 
      parallelize: true
      expect-regex: Test 3 done
```

## Sequential vs Parallel Execution

```yaml
- name: Mixed parallel and sequential tests
  tests:
    - name: Parallel test 1
      command: sleep 2 && echo "P1 done"
      parallelize: true
      expect-regex: P1 done
    
    - name: Parallel test 2
      command: sleep 2 && echo "P2 done"
      parallelize: true
      expect-regex: P2 done
    
    - name: Sequential test 1
      command: sleep 1 && echo "S1 done"
      parallelize: false
      expect-regex: S1 done
    
    - name: Sequential test 2
      command: sleep 1 && echo "S2 done"
      parallelize: false
      expect-regex: S2 done
```

## Timing Verification Tests

```yaml
- name: Verify parallel execution timing
  steps:
    - name: Record start time
      bash: |
        echo $(date +%s) > start_time.txt

      expect-regex: Start time recorded
    
    - name: Run parallel tasks (should take ~2 seconds total)
      tests:
        - name: Task 1 - 2 seconds
          command: sleep 2 && echo "Task 1 done"
          parallelize: true
          expect-regex: Task 1 done
        
        - name: Task 2 - 2 seconds
          command: sleep 2 && echo "Task 2 done"
          parallelize: true
          expect-regex: Task 2 done
        
        - name: Task 3 - 2 seconds
          command: sleep 2 && echo "Task 3 done"
          parallelize: true
          expect-regex: Task 3 done
    
    - name: Verify elapsed time
      bash: |
        end_time=$(date +%s)
        start_time=$(cat start_time.txt)
        elapsed=$((end_time - start_time))
        echo "Elapsed time: $elapsed seconds"
        if [ $elapsed -lt 5 ]; then
          echo "PARALLEL CONFIRMED: Elapsed time < 5 seconds"
        else
          echo "ERROR: Tasks took too long, parallelization may not be working"
          exit 1
        fi
      expect-regex: PARALLEL CONFIRMED
```
