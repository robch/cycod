# Unit Test Summary for YAML Test Framework

This document provides a summary of the unit test ideas created for each attribute in the YAML test framework.

## Attribute Coverage

The following YAML test framework attributes have detailed unit test ideas:

1. **Command, Script, Bash** - Tests for different command execution methods
2. **Tests, Steps** - Tests for test grouping and sequential step execution
3. **Expect-Regex** - Tests for regex-based output validation
4. **Not-Expect-Regex** - Tests for negative regex-based output validation
5. **Expect** - Tests for LLM-based output validation
6. **Env** - Tests for environment variable handling
7. **Input** - Tests for providing input to commands
8. **Parallelize** - Tests for parallel test execution
9. **SkipOnFailure** - Tests for failure handling
10. **Tag/Tags** - Tests for test categorization
11. **Timeout** - Tests for command execution timeouts
12. **WorkingDirectory** - Tests for directory context
13. **Matrix/Matrix-File** - Tests for parameterized test generation
14. **Name** - Tests for test identification
15. **Area/Class** - Tests for test organization

## Unit Test Categories

Each attribute has tests covering:

1. **Basic functionality** - Core feature tests
2. **Edge cases** - Unusual scenarios that might cause issues
3. **Error handling** - Tests for proper error reporting and recovery
4. **Combinations** - Tests for interactions between different attributes
5. **Platform specifics** - Tests for platform-dependent behavior

## Implementation Notes

These unit tests should be implemented as actual YAML test files that can be run with the test framework itself. This approach provides both validation of the framework and examples of its usage.

Key considerations for implementation:

1. Tests should be executable in isolation to verify specific functionality
2. Tests should include appropriate assertions to validate correct behavior
3. Tests should cover both success and failure scenarios
4. Platform-specific tests should be conditionally executed based on the environment

## Testing Priority

1. **High Priority**:
   - Command execution (command/script/bash) 
   - Basic output validation (expect-regex)
   - Environment variables (env)
   - Test organization (tests/steps)

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Matrix parameterization
   - Error handling (skipOnFailure)
   - Timeouts
   - Input handling

3. **Lower Priority**:
   - Advanced features (LLM-based validation)
   - Edge cases for all attributes
   - Complex attribute combinations

## Recommended Testing Approach

1. Create a separate test file for each attribute
2. Organize tests by functionality category
3. Include comments explaining expected behavior
4. Use a variety of simple commands that work across platforms
5. For platform-specific tests, detect the platform and skip if not applicable
6. Add validation for test report output format

## Next Steps

1. Implement the highest priority tests first
2. Set up a CI pipeline to run tests automatically
3. Document test results and any issues discovered
4. Extend test coverage based on identified gaps
5. Create integration tests that combine multiple attributes in realistic scenarios
