# Layer 6 Files Created - Summary

## Files I Created This Session

1. **docs/cycod-chat-filtering-pipeline-catalog-layer-6.md** (10,981 bytes)
2. **docs/cycod-chat-filtering-pipeline-proof-layer-6.md** (26,416 bytes)

## Verification Results

### a) ✅ Linking from Root Doc
- Root → Chat Index → Layer 6 Catalog → Layer 6 Proof
- All links working with bidirectional cross-references

### b) ✅ Full Set of Options
- 4 global options documented: `--interactive`, `--quiet`, `--verbose`, `--debug`
- 2 shortcuts documented: `--question`, `--questions`
- 6 display mechanisms documented (streaming, formatting, etc.)
- Total: 12 display control features fully documented with source code proof

### c) ⚠️ Coverage of All 9 Layers
- **Complete**: Layers 1-6 (6 files created before, 2 this session)
- **Missing**: Layers 7-9 (output persistence, AI processing, actions)
- **Status**: 67% complete (6 of 9 layers)

### d) ✅ Proof for Each Layer
- All 6 completed layers have comprehensive proof files
- Layer 6 proof has 50+ line number citations
- 30+ code excerpts with full context
- All assertions backed by source code evidence

## What This Means

✅ **Layer 6 is complete and verified**
⚠️ **Layers 7, 8, 9 still need to be created**

The documentation I created for Layer 6:
- Covers ALL display control options
- Provides complete source code proof
- Is properly linked from the root README
- Follows established documentation patterns
