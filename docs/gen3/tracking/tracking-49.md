# Tracking for Instance 49 - Custom Tools Spec Implementation

## Overview
This file tracks the progress of implementing enhancements to the CYCOD Custom Tools Specification based on the critique feedback. The work is broken down into units of work to ensure systematic progress.

## Units of Work

### 1. Initial Assessment
- [x] Review the existing custom-tools-spec-draft-1.md
- [x] Review critique documents (uber-critique and addendum)
- [x] Create tracking file
- [x] Identify key areas for improvement based on critiques
- [x] Review existing code implementation to ensure specification matches implementation

### 2. Planned Enhancements
Based on the critiques and code review, the following enhancements will be implemented in the specification:
- [x] LLM Function Calling Integration
- [x] Privilege Control and Security Boundaries
- [x] Parallel Execution Support
- [x] Output Streaming Options
- [x] Cross-Platform Path Handling
- [x] Tool Aliasing and Composition
- [x] Dynamic Parameter References
- [x] File-Based Definition Mode
- [x] Structured Categorization
- [x] Implementation Guidance
- [x] Testing Framework
- [x] Advanced Parameter Types and Validation
- [x] Error Handling and Recovery
- [x] Tool Versioning
- [x] Environment Variables

### 3. Implementation Progress
1. [x] Added LLM function calling integration to schema section
2. [x] Added detailed explanation of LLM function calling integration
3. [x] Verified security model with privilege control
4. [x] Verified parallel execution support documentation
5. [x] Verified output streaming options documentation
6. [x] Verified cross-platform path handling documentation
7. [x] Added comprehensive section on tool aliasing and composition
8. [x] Verified dynamic parameter references documentation
9. [x] Added file-based definition mode section
10. [x] Verified structured categorization documentation
11. [x] Verified implementation guidance documentation
12. [x] Verified testing framework documentation
13. [x] Verified advanced parameter types and validation documentation
14. [x] Verified error handling and recovery documentation
15. [x] Added tool versioning section
16. [x] Added environment variables section

## Working Notes
- Code review shows many of the critiqued features are already implemented in the code, but not documented in the specification
- The CustomToolModels.cs file already has models for function calling schema generation, security, parameter validation, and many other features
- The CustomToolExecutor.cs has implementation for parallel execution, error handling with retry logic, and output streaming
- Need to ensure the specification accurately reflects these existing capabilities while incorporating the critique feedback

## Summary
All the enhancements identified in the critiques have been either verified as already present in the specification or added as new sections:

1. **Added Sections**:
   - LLM Function Calling Integration
   - Tool Aliasing and Composition
   - File-Based Definition Mode
   - Tool Versioning
   - Environment Variables

2. **Verified Existing Features**:
   - Privilege Control and Security Boundaries
   - Parallel Execution Support
   - Output Streaming Options
   - Cross-Platform Path Handling
   - Dynamic Parameter References
   - Structured Categorization
   - Implementation Guidance
   - Testing Framework
   - Advanced Parameter Types and Validation
   - Error Handling and Recovery

The updated specification now comprehensively addresses all the critiques in the feedback documents while maintaining compatibility with the existing implementation.
