# Custom Tools Specification Implementation Tracking - Instance 2

This document tracks the implementation of the CYCOD Custom Tools Specification, incorporating feedback from the critiques.

## Final Implementation Status

I've successfully implemented the CYCOD Custom Tools Specification with the following components:

1. **Core Models and Factory Classes**
   - Created `CustomToolModels.cs` with YAML schema definitions
   - Implemented `CustomToolFactory.cs` for loading and managing tools
   - Built `CustomToolExecutor.cs` for executing tools
   - Developed `CustomToolFunctionFactory.cs` for LLM integration

2. **Enhanced Security Model**
   - Added security configuration with privilege controls
   - Implemented parameter security for shell metacharacter escaping
   - Added isolation options for tool execution

3. **Advanced Execution Features**
   - Implemented parallel execution support in multi-step tools
   - Added output streaming options for efficient handling of large outputs
   - Created cross-platform path handling utilities

4. **Tool Composition and Management**
   - Implemented tool aliasing and composition
   - Added dynamic parameter references
   - Created structured categorization with metadata

5. **Command Line Interface**
   - Implemented tool management commands (list, get, add, remove)
   - Added support for file-based tool definitions
   - Integrated with CYCOD's command-line interface

6. **Testing and Verification**
   - Added testing framework for tools
   - Ensured code compiles successfully

   - Added cross-platform path handling

4. **Usability Features**
   - Added tool aliasing and composition
   - Implemented dynamic parameter references
   - Added file-based definition mode
   - Implemented structured categorization

5. **Developer and Testing Features**
   - Added testing framework
   - Implemented resource management
   - Added advanced error handling

All of these enhancements were implemented based on the feedback from the critiques, resulting in a robust and flexible Custom Tools system for CYCOD.
