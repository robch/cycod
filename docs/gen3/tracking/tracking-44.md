# Custom Tools Spec Draft-1 Tracking - Instance 44

## Overview
This document tracks the changes made to the Custom Tools Specification Draft-1, incorporating feedback from the critiques.

## Analysis

After reviewing the current state of the specification, I've found that the custom-tools-spec-draft-1.md file has already been extensively updated to incorporate most, if not all, of the feedback from the critiques. The file includes:

1. LLM function calling integration
2. Security and privilege control enhancements
3. Execution enhancements (parallel execution, streaming output)
4. Cross-platform path handling
5. Tool aliasing and composition
6. Dynamic parameter references
7. Structured categorization
8. Implementation guidance for developers
9. Testing framework

The implementation has begun in the following files:
- src/cycod/CustomTools/CustomToolModels.cs
- src/cycod/CustomTools/CustomToolExecutor.cs
- src/cycod/CustomTools/CustomToolFactory.cs
- src/cycod/CustomTools/CustomToolFunctionFactory.cs
- src/cycod/CustomTools/McpFunctionFactoryExtensions.cs
- src/cycod/CustomTools/PathUtils.cs

Tests have also been added in:
- tests/cycod/CustomTools/CustomToolsTests.cs

## Verification Steps Taken

1. **Code Compilation**: Ran `dotnet build -c Release` in the src/cycod directory. The build succeeded with some warnings but no errors.

2. **Test Execution**: Ran `dotnet test -c Release` in the tests/cycod directory. All 261 tests passed.

3. **Specification Review**: Thoroughly reviewed the custom-tools-spec-draft-1.md file to ensure it addresses all the feedback from the critiques. The specification is comprehensive and well-structured.

## Conclusion

The custom-tools-spec-draft-1.md file appears to be comprehensive and addresses all the feedback from the critiques. The implementation is still in progress but is following the specification closely. The current implementation builds successfully and passes all tests.

No additional changes to the specification were needed as it already incorporates all the feedback from the critiques in a coherent and comprehensive manner.
