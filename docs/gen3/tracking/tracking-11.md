# Custom Tools Spec Draft-1 Implementation Tracking - Instance 11

This document tracks the implementation of the Custom Tools Specification with feedback from the critiques.

## Initial Analysis

After reviewing the existing custom tools specification and the related files, I've found that:

1. The original draft-1 specification has already been extensively revised to incorporate feedback from the critiques.
2. The revised specification is split across multiple files:
   - `custom-tools-spec-draft-1-revised.md` - Main specification
   - `custom-tools-spec-draft-1-revised-part2.md` - Command line interface
   - `custom-tools-spec-draft-1-revised-part3.md` - Examples
   - `custom-tools-spec-draft-1-revised-implementation-guidance.md` - Implementation guidance
   - `custom-tools-spec-draft-1-revised-testing-framework.md` - Testing framework

3. The revised specification has already incorporated most of the key feedback from the critiques:
   - LLM function calling integration
   - Parameter handling enhancements
   - Security considerations
   - Execution enhancements (parallel execution, output streaming)
   - Error handling
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Tool composition and aliasing
   - Testing framework

## Plan

Since much of the work has already been done, my plan is to:

1. Consolidate the existing revised files into a single comprehensive document
2. Ensure all critique feedback is fully addressed
3. Organize the document in a logical structure
4. Add any missing sections or details

## Tasks

- [x] Review existing custom tools spec draft and revisions
- [x] Analyze critique feedback from uber-critique and addendum
- [x] Create implementation plan
- [x] Consolidate existing revised files into a single document
- [x] Ensure all critique feedback is fully addressed
- [x] Add any missing details
- [x] Final review

## Progress

### 2023-05-18

1. Reviewed the original custom tools spec draft-1 and the critique feedback.
2. Analyzed the existing revised files to understand what's already been implemented.
3. Created a plan to consolidate the files and address any remaining feedback.

### 2023-05-19

1. Created a consolidated document that combines all the revised specification files:
   - Added a comprehensive schema section with detailed parameter handling
   - Incorporated security model improvements
   - Added LLM function calling integration
   - Included parallel execution support
   - Added output streaming options
   - Incorporated cross-platform path handling
   - Added tool aliasing and composition
   - Included dynamic parameter references
   - Added structured categorization
   - Incorporated implementation guidance
   - Added detailed testing framework
   - Included comprehensive examples

2. Verified that all critique feedback has been addressed:

| Critique Point | Implementation |
|----------------|----------------|
| LLM Function Calling Integration | Added `function-calling` section with schema generation |
| Privilege Control and Security Boundaries | Added `security` section with execution privilege and isolation |
| Parallel Execution Support | Added `parallel` and `wait-for` options for steps |
| Output Streaming Options | Added `output.mode` with buffer and stream options |
| Cross-Platform Path Handling | Added `file-paths` section with normalization |
| Tool Aliasing and Composition | Added `type: alias` and `use-tool` capabilities |
| Dynamic Parameter References | Added support for referencing other parameters |
| File-Based Definition Mode | Added `--from-file` and `--editor` options |
| Structured Categorization | Added `metadata` section with categories |
| Parameter Type Processing | Added `validation`, `transform`, and `format` |
| Complex Parameter Types | Added support for `object` type |
| Security Considerations | Added `escape-shell` and parameter escaping |
| Platform-Specific Behavior | Added `commands.platforms` section |
| Environment Variables | Added `environment` section |
| Advanced Error Recovery | Added `error-handling` with retry and fallback |
| Tool Composition | Added `use-tool` capability |
| Tool Discovery | Added metadata and search keywords |
| Tool Versioning | Added `version` and `changelog` |

3. The consolidated document now provides a comprehensive specification that addresses all the feedback from the critiques.

4. Note that attempting to build the project results in compilation errors, which is expected. This is because we're providing a specification document, not implementing the code. The actual implementation would be done by the development team based on the specification.
