# Custom Tools Specification Implementation Tracking - Instance 3

This document tracks the implementation of the CYCOD Custom Tools Specification, incorporating feedback from the critiques.

## Work Plan

1. Review the current specification and critique feedback
2. Check existing implementation progress from tracking-1.md and tracking-2.md
3. Create the directory structure for Custom Tools
4. Implement core models and interfaces
5. Implement tool management (add, get, list, remove commands)
6. Enhance parameter handling with validation and transformation
7. Implement security model with privilege controls
8. Add execution enhancements (parallel execution, output streaming)
9. Implement tool composition and aliasing
10. Add cross-platform path handling
11. Ensure proper LLM function calling integration
12. Add testing framework
13. Update documentation with examples

## Implementation Progress

### Task 1: Initial Review - COMPLETED
- [x] Review current specification draft
- [x] Analyze critique feedback and identify key improvements
- [x] Check existing implementation progress
- [x] Create implementation tracking document

### Task 2: Analysis of Existing Implementation - COMPLETED
- [x] Analyze existing code structure and files
- [x] Identify core components already implemented
- [x] Identify issues with the current implementation
- [x] Create a plan for fixing issues and completing implementation

### Key Findings from Existing Implementation:

1. **Core Models**: 
   - The `CustomToolDefinition` class and related models are well-designed and include all necessary properties from the specification and critiques.
   - Validation is currently a stub and needs implementation.

2. **Factory and Executor Classes**:
   - `CustomToolFactory` handles loading, saving, and managing tools from different scopes.
   - `CustomToolExecutor` handles executing tools, including multi-step tools, parameter substitution, and error handling.
   - `CustomToolFunctionFactory` integrates tools with CYCOD's function calling system.

3. **Command Line Interface**:
   - Command classes for tool management (add, get, list, remove) exist but are not fully implemented.
   - There are build errors with command implementation that need to be fixed.

4. **Features Already Implemented**:
   - Parameter types and validation structure
   - Multi-step tools with conditional execution
   - Error handling with retry and fallback
   - Scopes (local, user, global)
   - Security model with tags

5. **Features That Need Implementation**:
   - Actual command execution in `CustomToolExecutor`
   - Function calling integration with AITools
   - Command line interface implementation
   - Validation logic
   - Testing framework

### Task 3: Implement Core Features - PARTIALLY COMPLETED
- [x] Implement parameter validation logic
- [x] Add parameter transformation capabilities
- [x] Implement cross-platform path handling
- [ ] Fix build errors in existing implementation
- [ ] Update CustomToolFactory to use the new validation methods
- [ ] Update CustomToolFunctionFactory for proper LLM integration

### Build Issues Encountered:

1. **Validate Method Parameter Missing**:
   - `CustomToolDefinition.Validate()` method signature was changed to include an out parameter but the calling code wasn't updated
   - ```csharp
     // Current code
     tool.Validate()
     
     // Fix
     if (!tool.Validate(out string? errorMessage))
     {
         // Handle validation error
     }
     ```

2. **Method Signature Mismatches**:
   - `CustomToolFactory.AddTool()` and `GetTool()` methods don't match our implementation's expected signatures
   - ```csharp
     // Our implementation
     var tool = toolFactory.GetTool(ToolName, scope);
     var added = toolFactory.AddTool(tool, scope);
     
     // Actual signatures might be different
     var tool = toolFactory.GetTool(ToolName); // If it doesn't accept scope
     toolFactory.AddTool(tool); // If it doesn't return a value or take a scope
     ```

3. **Command Integration Issues**:
   - The `Command.AddChild()` method doesn't exist or has a different name
   - ```csharp
     // Our implementation
     rootCommand.AddChild(toolListCommand);
     
     // Actual method might be different
     rootCommand.Add(toolListCommand);
     ```

4. **Function Factory Integration**:
   - The `AddCustomToolFunctionsAsync` extension method isn't compatible with `McpFunctionFactory`
   - ```csharp
     // Current code
     var functionFactory = await _mcpFunctionFactory.AddCustomToolFunctionsAsync();
     
     // Fix (need to create an overload for McpFunctionFactory)
     public static async Task<CustomToolFunctionFactory> AddCustomToolFunctionsAsync(this McpFunctionFactory factory)
     {
         // Implementation that works with McpFunctionFactory
     }
     ```

5. **AITool to MethodInfo Conversion**:
   - There's an issue with how AITools are converted to MethodInfo
   - ```csharp
     // Current code
     foreach (var tool in factory.GetAITools())
     {
         customToolFactory.AddFunction(tool);
     }
     
     // Fix (might need conversion)
     foreach (var tool in factory.GetAITools())
     {
         customToolFactory.AddFunction(tool.Method); // If AITool has a Method property
     }
     ```

6. **Parameter Name Issues**:
   - Some method calls use named parameters that don't match the actual parameter names
   - ```csharp
     // Current code
     AIFunction.Create(instance: tool.ToMethodInfo());
     
     // Fix
     AIFunction.Create(tool.ToMethodInfo());
     ```

### Next Steps to Fix Build Issues:

1. **Fix Method Signatures**:
   - Investigate the actual signatures of `GetTool()`, `AddTool()`, and other methods
   - Update our implementation to match the existing codebase

2. **Fix Command Integration**:
   - Check how the Command class actually adds children
   - Update our extension methods to use the correct method names

3. **Fix Function Factory Integration**:
   - Investigate how AITools are created and managed
   - Update our implementation to properly integrate with the function factory

4. **Incremental Approach**:
   - Fix one issue at a time
   - Build after each change to ensure progress
   - Focus on core functionality first

## Conclusion

The Custom Tools implementation has made significant progress with core features implemented, but further integration work is needed to align with the existing codebase. The parameter validation and transformation capabilities have been implemented according to the specification and critiques, and cross-platform path handling has been added to improve usability across different operating systems.

While build errors currently prevent full functionality, the implementation is well-structured and incorporates the key enhancements requested in the critiques, including:
- Comprehensive parameter validation
- Type transformation
- Cross-platform path handling
- Security considerations

With further integration work to fix the build issues, the Custom Tools feature will provide CYCOD users with a powerful and flexible way to define, share, and execute shell commands through LLM function calling.
