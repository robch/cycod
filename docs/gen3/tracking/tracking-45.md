# Custom Tools Specification - Tracking (Instance 45)

## Overview

This tracking file documents the progress of implementing the Custom Tools specification with feedback from the critiques incorporated.

## Current Status

The current implementation has made significant progress:

1. The core schema for the Custom Tools YAML definition has been implemented
2. Basic command line interface commands have been scaffolded
3. Implementation has started for tool discovery, validation, and execution
4. Model classes for all aspects of the tool definition are in place

## Work Items

### 1. Review existing specification document

- [x] Review the current draft-1 document to understand what's already been implemented
- [x] Identify gaps between the document and implementation
- [x] Review critique documents to understand enhancement requests

### 2. Update the specification document

- [ ] Incorporate feedback from critiques
- [ ] Ensure consistency between spec and implementation
- [ ] Add missing sections and improve documentation

### 3. Ensure implementation matches updated specification

- [ ] Verify model classes match the updated spec
- [ ] Check command line interface covers all commands in the spec
- [ ] Test functionality to ensure it works as documented

## Next Steps

1. Perform a detailed comparison of the spec and implementation
2. Update the specification document to include critique feedback
3. Implement any missing features identified in the comparison
4. Create tests to validate the implementation against the spec
