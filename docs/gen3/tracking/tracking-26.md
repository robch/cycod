# Instance 26 Work Tracking

This file tracks the review and verification work done by instance 26 on the CYCOD Custom Tools Specification based on the critique feedback.

## Initial Assessment

- Reviewed custom-tools-spec-draft-1.md to understand the original specification
- Analyzed the critique feedback from custom-tools-spec-draft-1-uber-critique.md and custom-tools-spec-draft-1-uber-critique-addendum.md
- Checked existing tracking files (especially tracking-25.md) to understand the current state of work
- Reviewed the custom-tools-implementation-status.md document

## Investigation Findings

After thorough investigation, I have confirmed that:

1. The CYCOD Custom Tools Specification has been comprehensively enhanced to address all the feedback from the critiques.
2. A consolidated specification document (`custom-tools-spec-draft-1-consolidated-fixed.md`) has been created that includes all the suggested improvements.
3. The implementation in the codebase is partially complete, with the model classes fully defined but some executor implementation still in progress.
4. Based on tracking-25.md, all 261 tests are passing, indicating that the core functionality is working properly.

## Verification of Key Features

I've verified that the specification now includes all the key features suggested in the critiques:

1. **LLM Function Calling Integration**:
   - Schema generation for LLM function calling
   - Parameter mapping from tool types to JSON Schema types
   - Inclusion of descriptions and defaults
   - Example generation

2. **Security Controls**:
   - Execution privilege levels (same-as-user, reduced, elevated)
   - Isolation modes (none, process, container)
   - Required permissions specification
   - Justification field for security implications

3. **Parallel Execution Support**:
   - Steps can be executed in parallel
   - Dependencies can be specified using `wait-for`
   - Conditional execution based on previous step results

4. **Output Streaming**:
   - Support for both buffered and streamed output
   - Buffer limits for large outputs
   - Stream callbacks for real-time processing

5. **Cross-Platform Path Handling**:
   - Path normalization across platforms
   - Working directory specification
   - Platform-specific separator handling

6. **Tool Composition and Aliasing**:
   - Tools can use other tools as steps
   - Simplified versions of tools with preset parameters
   - Parameter passing between tools

7. **Advanced Parameter Handling**:
   - Validation rules for parameters
   - Transformation functions
   - Dynamic references to other parameters
   - Detailed help and examples

8. **Structured Categorization**:
   - Hierarchical categories and subcategories
   - Tags for organization and security
   - Search keywords for discovery

9. **Testing Framework**:
   - Structured approach for testing tools
   - Expected results and assertions
   - Cleanup actions

## Conclusion

The CYCOD Custom Tools Specification is complete and has successfully incorporated all the feedback from the critiques. The consolidated documentation provides a clear, structured, and detailed specification that covers all aspects of custom tools implementation.

While some aspects of the implementation in the executor classes are still being completed, the specification itself is fully documented and ready for reference.

No further changes are needed to the specification at this time, as it comprehensively addresses all the critique feedback and provides a clear roadmap for full implementation.
