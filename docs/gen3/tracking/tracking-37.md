# Custom Tools Spec Draft-1 Revision Tracking

This file tracks the work done to revise the Custom Tools Specification Draft-1 based on the critique feedback.

## Initial Analysis

I've analyzed the current state of the implementation and the critique feedback. The main areas that need to be addressed are:

1. LLM Function Calling Integration
2. Privilege Control and Security Boundaries
3. Parameter Handling (Type Processing, Validation, Documentation)
4. Command Execution (Security, Platform-specific behavior)
5. Error Handling and Recovery
6. Tool Composition and Reusability
7. Tool Testing Framework
8. Documentation and Usability

## Implementation Plan

I'll approach this work in the following steps:

1. Update the spec to include the LLM Function Calling Integration section
2. Add the Security Enhancements section
3. Enhance Parameter Handling 
4. Add Execution Enhancements
5. Improve Tool Composition and Reusability
6. Add Tool Testing Framework
7. Update examples to demonstrate new features
8. Review and finalize

## Work Log

### 2023-09-25

1. **Schema Updates**
   - Added versioning information to tool schema
   - Enhanced parameter types to include object
   - Added validation rules for parameters
   - Added parameter transforms and formatting
   - Added example values for parameters
   - Added security configuration for parameter escaping

2. **LLM Function Calling Integration**
   - Added a new section for LLM Function Calling Integration
   - Documented schema generation configuration
   - Added example of how LLM function schemas are generated
   - Explained discovery and invocation process

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Enhanced Security Model section with privilege control
   - Added isolation options (none, process, container)
   - Added required permissions configuration
   - Enhanced parameter security with escape options

4. **Execution Enhancements**
   - Added parallel execution support
   - Added output management options (buffering vs streaming)
   - Added error handling with retry and fallback options
   - Added cross-platform path handling
   - Added environment variable configuration

5. **Tool Composition and Reusability**
   - Added tool aliasing capability
   - Added tool referencing in multi-step tools
   - Enhanced metadata for better discovery
   - Added structured categorization

6. **Testing Framework**
   - Added tool testing configuration
   - Added test parameters, expectations, and cleanup
   - Added command line interface for testing tools

7. **CLI Enhancements**
   - Added new commands: test, validate, edit, export, import
   - Enhanced existing commands with more options
   - Added file-based definition support

8. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated all examples to demonstrate new features
   - Added detailed help text for all commands
   - Added predefined variables section
   - Enhanced parameter substitution documentation
   - Added parameter transforms and formatting documentation

All these changes have been implemented in the specification document, making it more comprehensive and addressing the key points raised in the critique feedback.

## Final Review

I've verified that all the critique points from both the uber-critique and the addendum have been addressed:

1. **LLM Function Calling Integration** ✅
   - Added section explaining how tools are represented to LLMs
   - Added schema generation configuration
   - Documented parameter mapping
   - Added examples showing how schemas are generated

2. **Privilege Control and Security Boundaries** ✅
   - Added execution privilege levels
   - Added isolation options
   - Added required permissions configuration
   - Added parameter security options

3. **Parameter Handling** ✅
   - Added validation rules
   - Added transforms and formatting
   - Added examples and detailed help
   - Added security escaping
   - Added complex parameter types (object)

4. **Command Execution** ✅
   - Added platform-specific command variations
   - Added environment variable configuration
   - Added cross-platform path handling
   - Added security considerations

5. **Error Handling and Recovery** ✅
   - Added retry and fallback options
   - Added output management (buffering/streaming)
   - Added conditional execution options

6. **Tool Composition and Reusability** ✅
   - Added tool aliasing
   - Added tool referencing in multi-step tools
   - Added metadata for better discovery
   - Added structured categorization

7. **Tool Testing Framework** ✅
   - Added testing configuration
   - Added CLI commands for testing
   - Added expectations and assertions
   - Added cleanup mechanisms

8. **Documentation and Usability** ✅
   - Enhanced all examples
   - Added detailed help text for all commands
   - Added best practices (through examples)
   - Added file-based definition options

The build and tests pass successfully with the updated specification. The revised specification provides a solid foundation for implementing custom tools in CYCOD that can be effectively used by LLMs through function calling.
