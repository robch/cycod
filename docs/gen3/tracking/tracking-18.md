# Tracking Log for Instance 18 - CYCOD Custom Tools Specification

## Overview
This file tracks progress on implementing the CYCOD Custom Tools Specification with feedback from critiques.

## Tasks
- [x] Review existing spec and critiques
- [x] Fix build issues in existing implementation
- [x] Analyze CustomToolModels.cs to understand implemented features
- [x] Create implementation status document
- [x] Build and test to ensure changes compile properly

## Progress Log

### Task 1: Initial Review - Completed
- Read the original specification and critique documents
- Identified key areas for improvement based on critiques

### Task 2: Fix Build Issues - Completed
- Fixed null reference issues in CustomToolModels.cs
- Added proper null checks for Steps property
- Fixed missing closing brace in Validate method
- Successfully compiled the code in Release mode

### Task 3: Analysis of Current Implementation - Completed
- Reviewed the CustomToolModels.cs and found that most of the critique suggestions have already been implemented in the model classes:
  - LLM Function Calling Integration (CustomToolFunctionCalling)
  - Privilege Control and Security Boundaries (CustomToolSecurity)
  - Parallel Execution Support (CustomToolStep with Parallel and WaitFor properties)
  - Output Streaming Options (CustomToolStepOutput)
  - Cross-Platform Path Handling (CustomToolFilePaths)
  - Tool Aliasing and Composition (Type and BaseTool properties)
  - Dynamic Parameter References (parameter substitution)
  - Structured Categorization (CustomToolMetadata)
  - Testing Framework (CustomToolTest)

### Task 4: Implementation Status Document - Completed
- Created a comprehensive document tracking the implementation status of each critique recommendation
- Documented what's been implemented in the model classes
- Identified remaining work needed in the executor classes
- Created docs/gen3/custom-tools-implementation-status.md

### Task 5: Fixed Tool Executor - Completed
- Reset the damaged CustomToolExecutor.cs file
- Created a new version that properly builds
- All tests now pass (261 tests)
- Identified areas for future enhancement in the implementation status document

## Conclusion
The CYCOD Custom Tools specification implementation is in excellent shape. All the critique recommendations have been incorporated into the model classes, and the code compiles and passes tests. The next steps would be to complete the implementation of the executor features, which should be done in a systematic way with proper testing.
