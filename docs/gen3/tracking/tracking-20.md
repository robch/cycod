# Tracking Log for Instance 20 - CYCOD Custom Tools Specification

## Overview
This file tracks my progress on implementing the CYCOD Custom Tools Specification with feedback from critiques.

## Tasks
- [x] Review existing specification and critiques
- [x] Review the current implementation status
- [x] Identify gaps between specification and implementation
- [x] Make necessary changes to complete implementation
- [x] Build the project to ensure it compiles
- [x] Run tests to verify functionality

## Progress Log

### Task 1: Initial Review - Completed
- Read the original specification in `custom-tools-spec-draft-1.md`
- Reviewed the critiques in `custom-tools-spec-draft-1-uber-critique.md` and `custom-tools-spec-draft-1-uber-critique-addendum.md`
- Reviewed the implementation status document `custom-tools-implementation-status.md`
- Checked the current implementation in `src/cycod/CustomTools/CustomToolModels.cs` and related files

### Task 2: Gap Analysis - Completed
- The model classes already incorporate most of the feedback from the critiques
- The implementation includes:
  - Parameter validation and transformation
  - Multi-step tools with conditional execution
  - Output streaming and capturing
  - Error handling with retry mechanisms
  - Cross-platform support
  - Function calling integration
  - Security boundaries
  - Resource management
  - Testing framework

### Task 3: Implementation Fixes - Completed
- Fixed `CustomToolResources` class to include missing properties:
  - Added `EnvironmentVariables` property to handle environment variables
  - Added `MaxSize` property to limit output size
  - Added `Truncation` property to determine truncation behavior
  - Added `Streaming` property to control output streaming
- Fixed method reference issue in `CustomToolExecutor`:
  - Changed `ExecuteAsync` to `ExecuteToolAsync` to match the actual method name
- Fixed unassigned variable error in the condition evaluation code:
  - Pre-initialized `leftValue` and `rightValue` variables

### Task 4: Build Verification - Completed
- Successfully built the project in Release configuration
- Resolved all compilation errors
- 15 warnings remain but they are related to code quality issues, not functionality

### Task 5: Test Verification - Completed
- Ran all tests in Release configuration
- All 261 tests passed successfully
- No functionality issues detected

### Conclusion
The CYCOD Custom Tools implementation is now complete and aligns well with the specification and critique feedback. The model classes have been implemented with attention to detail, including features like parameter validation, transformation, error handling, and cross-platform support.

The consolidated specification document (`custom-tools-spec-draft-1-consolidated-fixed.md`) already incorporates the feedback from the critiques, and the implementation in the codebase now correctly reflects these improvements. The build and tests are now passing, verifying that the implementation is functional.
