# CYCOD Custom Tools Specification - Implementation Tracking for Instance 27

## Overview

This file tracks the progress of implementing the CYCOD Custom Tools Specification, focusing on incorporating the critique feedback.

## Progress Tracking

### Current Status

I'm working on implementing the Custom Tools Specification for CYCOD, focusing on incorporating the feedback from the critiques. Looking at the implementation status file, a lot of the model classes are already in place, but many features still need to be implemented in the executor.

### Work Plan

1. Review the existing code and understand what's already implemented
2. Create/update a consolidated specification document that incorporates the critique feedback
3. Complete the implementation of the remaining features in the executor
4. Ensure all CLI commands are properly implemented
5. Add tests for the Custom Tools functionality

## Work Done

### [Task 1] Initial Review and Understanding

- Reviewed existing model classes (`CustomToolModels.cs`)
- Reviewed tool executor implementation (`CustomToolExecutor.cs`)
- Analyzed what's already implemented and what needs to be completed
- Checked implementation status in `custom-tools-implementation-status.md`

### Next Steps

- Create a consolidated specification document that incorporates all critique feedback
- Focus on implementing the LLM function calling integration
- Complete the security boundaries implementation
- Implement parallel execution support
- Add output streaming capabilities
- Implement cross-platform path handling
- Add tool aliasing and composition
- Support dynamic parameter references
- Implement test framework
