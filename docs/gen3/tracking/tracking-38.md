# Tracking for Instance 38 - Custom Tools Spec Draft-1

## Overview

This document tracks the work done on the CYCOD Custom Tools specification draft-1, implementing feedback from critiques to enhance the specification.

## Current State Assessment

I've examined the existing `custom-tools-spec-draft-1.md` file and found that it has already been extensively updated to incorporate most of the feedback from the critiques. The spec now includes:

1. **LLM Function Calling Integration** - Added section for LLM schema generation and integration
2. **Privilege Control and Security Boundaries** - Enhanced security model with execution privilege levels and isolation options
3. **Parallel Execution Support** - Added step options for parallel execution and dependencies
4. **Output Streaming Options** - Added configuration for output buffering vs streaming
5. **Cross-Platform Path Handling** - Added file path normalization and platform-specific handling
6. **Tool Aliasing and Composition** - Added support for tool aliases
7. **Dynamic Parameter References** - Added support for parameters referencing other parameters
8. **File-Based Definition Mode** - Added CLI options for file-based tool definitions
9. **Structured Categorization** - Added metadata section for better categorization
10. **Testing Framework** - Added comprehensive testing framework

All the key enhancement areas from the critiques have been addressed in the current version of the spec.

## Next Steps

Since most of the critical improvements have already been implemented, I'll focus on:

1. Validating the spec for completeness and consistency
2. Ensuring that the build system works with the updated spec
3. Checking that the documentation is clear and comprehensive

Let me proceed with these tasks.
