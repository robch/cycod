# Tracking for Instance 13

This file tracks the work done by instance 13 to complete the custom tools spec draft-1, incorporating feedback from the critiques.

## Initial Assessment

Starting with review of existing files:
- custom-tools-spec-draft-1.md - Original draft
- custom-tools-spec-draft-1-uber-critique.md - Consolidated critique
- custom-tools-spec-draft-1-uber-critique-addendum.md - Additional critique points
- custom-tools-spec-draft-1-consolidated.md - Consolidated specification (mostly complete)
- custom-tools-spec-draft-1-revised.md - Revised main specification
- custom-tools-spec-draft-1-revised-part2.md - Command line interface section
- custom-tools-spec-draft-1-revised-part3.md - Examples section
- custom-tools-spec-draft-1-revised-implementation-guidance.md - Implementation guidance
- custom-tools-spec-draft-1-revised-testing-framework.md - Testing framework

## Current Status

After careful review, I found that the consolidated specification (custom-tools-spec-draft-1-consolidated.md) is already very comprehensive and includes most of the feedback from the critiques. It has sections for all key areas including:

- LLM function calling integration
- Security configuration with privilege control
- Parameter validation and transformation
- Error handling and recovery
- Parallel execution
- Output streaming
- Tool composition and aliasing
- Testing framework

The specification is well-structured and covers all the major points raised in the critiques. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. There is duplication in the Security Configuration section where logging and auditing subsections appear twice
2. Some sections could benefit from expanded explanations and examples
3. Cross-references and consistency should be verified

## Work Plan

1. Create a final version of the consolidated specification that:
   - Fixes the duplication in the Security Configuration section
   - Enhances the LLM Function Calling Integration section with more details
   - Ensures all examples demonstrate the new features effectively
   - Verifies cross-references and consistency
   - Addresses any remaining gaps from the critiques

2. Build the solution to verify there are no issues with the specification (note: there are currently build errors in the implementation code, but this is expected since it's a work in progress)

## Progress

1. Analyzed existing specifications and code structure
2. Identified that the consolidated specification is mostly complete and addresses most critique feedback
3. Identified specific issues to fix in the final version
4. Next step: Create the final version of the specification
