# Tracking Work for Custom Tools Spec Draft-1

## Overview

This file tracks the work done to enhance the Custom Tools Specification draft-1 with the feedback from the critiques.

## Initial Assessment

I've reviewed the original custom tools spec draft-1 and the critique documents:
- `custom-tools-spec-draft-1.md`: The original specification
- `custom-tools-spec-draft-1-uber-critique.md`: Comprehensive review with enhancement opportunities
- `custom-tools-spec-draft-1-uber-critique-addendum.md`: Additional considerations

It seems that several enhancement sections have already been created:
- `llm-function-calling-section.md`: Integration with LLM function calling
- `security-enhancements-section.md`: Security model enhancements
- `parameter-enhancements-section.md`: Parameter validation and transformation
- `execution-enhancements-section.md`: Parallel execution and output streaming
- `tool-composition-section.md`: Tool composition and aliasing
- `usability-features-section.md`: File-based definition and interactive mode
- `tool-testing-framework-section.md`: Testing framework
- `implementation-guidance-section.md`: Implementation details for developers
- `documentation-best-practices-section.md`: Best practices

## Plan of Action

1. Create a consolidated specification file that integrates all the feedback
2. Ensure all critique points are addressed
3. Add additional examples for advanced features
4. Maintain consistency with CYCOD conventions
5. Build and verify the solution

## Work Log

### Step 1: Create Consolidated Specification

I'll create a consolidated specification file that incorporates all the enhancement sections while maintaining the structure of the original specification.
