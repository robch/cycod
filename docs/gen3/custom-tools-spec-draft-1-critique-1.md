# Critique of CYCOD Custom Tools Specification - Draft 1

## Overview

The CYCOD Custom Tools Specification draft is comprehensive and well-structured. It clearly defines the purpose, implementation, and usage of the custom tools feature. Here's my detailed critique:

## Strengths

1. **Clear Structure**: The document follows a logical progression from conceptual overview to specific implementation details.

2. **Comprehensive Examples**: The inclusion of various examples covering simple and complex use cases helps illustrate the concepts effectively.

3. **Complete CLI Documentation**: The command-line interface is thoroughly documented with options and examples.

4. **Security Integration**: The specification correctly integrates with CYCOD's existing security model for function calling.

5. **Help Text**: Including draft help text is valuable for showing how the feature will be presented to users.

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Parameter Substitution Clarity**: 
   - The spec uses curly braces `{PARAM}` for parameter substitution but doesn't explicitly state how this interacts with shell-specific syntax that might also use curly braces.
   - Consider adding examples of escaping curly braces when they're part of the command syntax.

2. **Boolean Parameter Handling**:
   - In the "Complex Parameter Handling" example, there are comments about converting boolean values to command-line flags (`-i` for false, `-w` for true), but the mechanism for this conversion isn't specified.
   - Consider explicitly defining how boolean parameters are transformed into command arguments.

3. **Parameter Validation**:
   - The specification doesn't address parameter validation behavior. Will there be any validation for parameter types (e.g., ensuring a number parameter contains a valid number)?
   - Consider clarifying whether validation occurs or is left to the shell command execution.

4. **Step Output Buffering**:
   - For multi-step tools, there's no mention of potential memory considerations when capturing large outputs from steps.
   - Consider addressing potential limitations or buffering strategies for large outputs.

5. **Run Conditions**:
   - The run-condition syntax (`"{step1.exit-code} == 0"`) implies complex condition evaluation, but the mechanism for this evaluation isn't specified.
   - Consider clarifying how conditions are evaluated (simple string comparison vs. expression parsing).

6. **Platform-Specific Behavior**:
   - While the specification includes platform tags, it doesn't address how to handle platform-specific command variations within a single tool.
   - Consider adding guidance for creating tools that work across platforms with different command syntax.

7. **Integration with Function Calling**:
   - The specification doesn't fully address how tools will appear in function calling schemas for LLMs.
   - Consider adding details about the JSON Schema representation for LLM function calling.

## Suggested Additions

1. **Tool Testing**:
   - Add guidance on testing custom tools before using them with LLMs.
   - Consider a test command like `cycod tool test NAME [parameters]`.

2. **Tool Sharing Mechanism**:
   - Consider addressing how tools might be shared between users or teams beyond the scope system.

3. **Environment Variable Support**:
   - Add support for environment variables in tool definitions that would be set before command execution.

4. **Tool Dependencies**:
   - Consider adding a mechanism for tools to declare dependencies (e.g., required executables or other tools).

5. **Tool Versioning**:
   - Add support for tool versioning to track changes and compatibility.

## Conclusion

The CYCOD Custom Tools Specification provides a solid foundation for implementing this feature. With some clarifications and additions as suggested above, it will be a comprehensive guide for both implementation and user documentation.

The multi-step tool support with output capturing and conditional execution is particularly powerful and sets this feature apart from simple command wrapping. The integration with CYCOD's existing scope and security models shows thoughtful design.
