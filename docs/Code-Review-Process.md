# Code Review Process

This document outlines our code review process, principles, and best practices. Code reviews are a critical part of our development workflow, ensuring quality, knowledge sharing, and consistency across our codebase.

## 1. Core Principles

- **Constructive Feedback**: Focus on the code, not the person
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Use reviews as learning opportunities
- **Consistency**: Apply coding standards uniformly
- **Collaboration**: Work together to find the best solution
- **Timeliness**: Provide prompt reviews to maintain development velocity

## 2. Review Process

### 2.1 Before Submitting Code for Review

```
✓ Run all tests locally and ensure they pass
✓ Review your own code first (self-review)
✓ Ensure your code follows our coding standards
✓ Keep changes focused and reasonably sized
```

### 2.2 Submitting for Review

1. Create a pull request with a descriptive title
2. Include a clear description of:
   - What the changes accomplish
   - How to test the changes
   - Any potential risks or areas of concern
3. Link related issues or requirements
4. Assign appropriate reviewers

### 2.3 Conducting a Review

1. Understand the context and purpose of the changes
2. Review the code against our [C# Coding Style guidelines](C%23-Coding-Style-Essential.md)
3. Verify functionality through manual testing when appropriate
4. Provide specific, actionable feedback
5. Distinguish between required changes and suggestions
6. Approve once all critical issues are addressed

## 3. Review Checklist

### 3.1 Functionality

- Does the code work as intended?
- Are edge cases handled appropriately?
- Is error handling comprehensive and consistent?
- Are there potential race conditions or concurrency issues?

### 3.2 Architecture & Design

- Does the code follow SOLID principles?
- Is the code modular and reusable?
- Are dependencies properly managed?
- Is the solution overly complex for the problem?

### 3.3 Performance

- Are there potential performance bottlenecks?
- Is resource utilization efficient?
- Are database queries optimized?
- Are expensive operations cached appropriately?

### 3.4 Security

- Is user input properly validated?
- Are authentication and authorization handled correctly?
- Are sensitive data properly protected?
- Are potential injection attacks prevented?

### 3.5 Testing

- Are there sufficient unit tests?
- Do tests cover happy paths and edge cases?
- Are tests readable and maintainable?
- Is mocking used appropriately?

### 3.6 Readability & Maintainability

- Is the code self-documenting with clear names?
- Is complex logic adequately commented?
- Is the code consistent with our style guidelines?
- Would a new team member understand the code?

## 4. Feedback Guidelines

### 4.1 Constructive Feedback Principles

- Be specific about what needs to change and why
- Provide examples when helpful
- Focus on facts rather than opinions
- Frame feedback positively and respectfully
- Use questions to understand reasoning

### 4.2 Effective Feedback Examples

```
// INEFFECTIVE:
"This code is confusing."

// EFFECTIVE:
"Consider extracting this logic into a named method to clarify its purpose.
This would make the control flow easier to follow."
```

```
// INEFFECTIVE:
"Why did you do it this way?"

// EFFECTIVE:
"I'm curious about the choice to use recursion here.
Have you considered an iterative approach for better performance with large inputs?"
```

## 5. Comprehensive Code Review Example

### 5.1 Functionality Verification through Code Review

For complex functionality, a comprehensive review might include:

```
Function | Status | Notes
---------|--------|------
CreateNamedShell | ✅ PASS | Verified shell creation with custom name
StartNamedProcess | ✅ PASS | Confirmed process starts with specified arguments
ExecuteInShell | ✅ PASS | Validated command execution in target shell
GetShellOrProcessOutput | ✅ PASS | Confirmed output retrieval functionality
```

### 5.2 Review Documentation

Document significant findings from code reviews, especially for complex components:

```markdown
## Implementation Challenges and Solutions

### Integration with Existing Code

We successfully integrated the new system with the existing codebase by:
- Extending ShellSession to support named instances
- Implementing a NamedShellManager as a central registry
- Adding resource monitoring capabilities
- Creating a unified API for commands and processes
```

## 6. Tool-Assisted Reviews

### 6.1 Automated Checks

Leverage automated tools to focus human reviewers on what matters most:

- Static code analysis
- Linting tools
- Test coverage reports
- Security scanners

### 6.2 Review Tools

- GitHub pull request reviews
- Code review comments
- Visual Studio Live Share for collaborative reviews
- Side-by-side diff viewers

## 7. Code Review Metrics

Track these metrics to improve your review process:

- Review turnaround time
- Number of comments per line of code
- Types of issues found
- Defects found in review vs. production

## 8. Special Review Considerations

### 8.1 High-Risk Code

Code handling critical operations, security, or data integrity requires additional scrutiny:

- Consider multiple reviewers
- Conduct security-focused reviews
- Document thorough testing
- Review error handling comprehensively

### 8.2 Junior Developer Code

When reviewing code from less experienced developers:

- Focus on teaching, not just finding issues
- Explain the "why" behind feedback
- Suggest resources for learning
- Acknowledge good practices and improvements

## 9. Common Review Patterns

Look for these common patterns during reviews:

### 9.1 Code Smells

- Duplicate code
- Long methods
- Deep nesting
- Inconsistent naming
- Magic numbers/strings
- Commented-out code

### 9.2 Architectural Concerns

- Tight coupling
- Leaky abstractions
- Violation of SOLID principles
- Inappropriate patterns

## 10. Self-Review Guidelines

Before requesting a review, developers should:

```
✓ Read through changes line-by-line as if reviewing someone else's code
✓ Ensure each change has a clear purpose
✓ Verify tests cover new functionality and edge cases
✓ Check that code follows project standards and best practices
✓ Look for opportunities to simplify or improve the solution
```

## Conclusion

Effective code reviews are a collaborative process that improves code quality and team knowledge. By following these guidelines, we create a positive review culture that strengthens our codebase and our team.
