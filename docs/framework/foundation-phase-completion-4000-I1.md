## Quality Distribution

- **Gold Standard (50/50)**: 1 section (Section 11)
- **Ready to Serve (45-49/50)**: 9 sections  
- **Development Ready (40-44/50)**: 12 sections
- **Average Score**: 43.6/50

## Cross-Domain Harmony Status ✅

Analogies are distributed across compatible domains:
- **Kitchen/Culinary**: 3 sections (11, 7, 26)
- **Workshop/Tools**: 4 sections (2, 13, 20, 27)
- **Organization/Storage**: 4 sections (1, 4, 6, 15)
- **Service/Process**: 3 sections (5, 12, 19)
