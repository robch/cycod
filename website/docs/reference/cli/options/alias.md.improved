# --ALIAS Option

The `--ALIAS` option allows you to use previously saved command aliases. It's a powerful shorthand way to invoke a set of pre-configured options with a single parameter.

## Syntax

```bash
cycod --ALIAS_NAME [additional options]
```

Where `ALIAS_NAME` is the name of a previously saved alias (without the `--` prefix).

## Description

When you invoke CycoD with the `--ALIAS_NAME` syntax (where `ALIAS_NAME` is the name of your saved alias), CycoD will:

1. Search for the specified alias in local, user, and global scopes (in that order)
2. Load all saved command options from the alias file
3. Apply those options to your current command
4. Continue processing any additional options you provide

This mechanism allows you to create shortcuts for frequently used commands and option combinations, saving you from repeatedly typing the same complex commands.

## How It Works

Unlike most command-line options that are explicitly defined in the application, the `--ALIAS` syntax is recognized dynamically:

1. CycoD receives a command-line option starting with `--` (e.g., `--python-expert`)
2. If it's not a built-in option, CycoD checks if it's a saved alias
3. If found, all options stored in the alias are applied to the command

## Alias Resolution

When looking for an alias, CycoD searches in this order:

1. Local scope (`.cycod/aliases` in the current directory)
2. User scope (`.cycod/aliases` in the user's home directory)
3. Global scope (system-wide directory available to all users)

This prioritization means a local alias takes precedence over a user alias with the same name, which takes precedence over a global alias.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Using an alias named "python-expert"
cycod --python-expert
```

This would apply all the options that were saved when creating the alias, such as:

```bash
# What might have been saved in the python-expert alias
--use-openai --openai-chat-model-name gpt-4o --add-system-prompt "You are an expert Python programmer."
```

### Real-world Example

Instead of typing this verbose command every time:

```bash
cycod --use-openai --add-system-prompt "You are an expert code reviewer. Analyze code for bugs, security issues, and performance optimizations." --openai-chat-model-name gpt-4o
```

You can save it as an alias:

```bash
cycod --use-openai --add-system-prompt "You are an expert code reviewer. Analyze code for bugs, security issues, and performance optimizations." --openai-chat-model-name gpt-4o --save-alias code-review
```

And then use it simply as:

```bash
cycod --code-review --question "Please review this code: [paste code here]"
```

### Combining with Additional Options

```bash
# Using the alias and adding a specific question
cycod --python-expert --question "How do I read JSON files in Python?"
```

The options specified in the `python-expert` alias will be applied first, followed by the additional `--question` option.

### Working with Files

```bash
# Using an alias with file operations
cycod --code-review file1.js file2.js --output-trajectory review-report.md
```

### Overriding Alias Options

If your alias sets a particular option that you want to override:

```bash
# If python-expert alias uses gpt-4, but you want to use a different model for this session
cycod --python-expert --openai-chat-model-name gpt-3.5-turbo --question "Explain list comprehensions"
```

The `--openai-chat-model-name` option specified in the command line will override the one in the alias.

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose of the alias
- Use dashes instead of spaces in alias names
- Consider prefixing aliases with categories (e.g., `py-` for Python-related aliases)
- Avoid names that match built-in CycoD options to prevent conflicts

### Avoid Naming Conflicts

Be careful not to create aliases with names that match existing CycoD options. For example, creating an alias named `question` would conflict with the `--question` option. If this happens, the built-in option takes precedence.
