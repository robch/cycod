# --continue

The `--continue` option allows you to automatically load and continue your most recent chat history without having to specify a filename.

## Syntax

```bash
cycod --continue [other options]
```

## Parameters

This option doesn't take any parameters.

## Behavior

When the `--continue` flag is used:

- CycoD searches for the most recently modified chat history file in the following locations (in order):
  1. The current directory
  2. Local scope history directory (`.cycod/history/`)
  3. User scope history directory (`%USERPROFILE%\.cycod\history/` on Windows or `~/.cycod/history/` on Unix/Mac)
- Both regular chat history files (`chat-history-*.jsonl`) and exception chat history files (`exception-chat-history-*.jsonl`) are considered
- Files are sorted by last write time to determine the most recent one
- The most recent chat history is automatically loaded, allowing your conversation to continue where you left off

By default, `--continue` alone does not save back to the same file. You need to either:
- Add `--output-chat-history auto` to save back to the same file that was loaded
- Use CycoD's automatic history saving feature (enabled by default)
- Specify another output file with `--output-chat-history <filename>`

    └── chat-history-*.jsonl (checked second)

User Profile
└── .cycod/
    └── history/
        └── chat-history-*.jsonl (checked third)
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Continue the most recent chat
cycod --continue --question "What were we talking about?"
```

### Interactive Mode

```bash
# Continue the most recent chat in interactive mode
cycod --continue --interactive
```

### Continue and Save to the Same File

```bash
# Continue the most recent chat and save new messages back to it
cycod --continue --output-chat-history auto
```

### Create a Branch From the Most Recent Conversation

```bash
# Continue the most recent chat but save to a new file (creating a branch)
cycod --continue --output-chat-history new-branch.jsonl --question "Let's explore an alternative approach"
```

### With Other Options

```bash
# Continue with a different model
cycod --continue --use-openai --openai-chat-model-name gpt-4
```

## Notes

- The `--continue` flag is overridden by `--chat-history` or `--input-chat-history` if they are specified in the same command
- If no chat history files are found, CycoD will start a new conversation
- CycoD will automatically trim the chat history if needed to stay within token limits
- Using `--continue` with `--output-chat-history auto` will save back to the same file that was loaded
- If multiple chat histories have identical modification times, CycoD will select one based on internal sorting rules, typically preferring files in the current directory
